Except lately it's been through email chains instead of in-person for the Grade 12 students in Lacombe, Alta. Such school clubs are meant to provide safe spaces for LGBTQ students and their allies. Students, teachers and community groups are working to ensure that support is still available as the COVID-19 pandemic keeps kids out of school. ""It's definitely harder because you want to be able to see those people and be around them,"" said Overacker, 18. ""But I think we are making the best out of the situation that we can and focusing on making sure that kids still know that there's people there to support them."" Overacker and Pallot want to hold a virtual end-of-year celebration for LGBTQ students. ""We're thinking it'll be over Zoom and we want it to be Alberta-wide,"" said Pallot, 17. She said community groups could host multiple Zoom sessions simultaneously. ""We'll have a Zoom room with a DJ and dancing and games and just multiple different ones that kids can choose."" Gay-straight alliances are moving online, to ensure support is still available during the pandemic. (Tiphanie Roquette/Radio-Canada/CBC) Pallot said the virtual prom is a way of ""finding light in this situation,"" with the bonus of meeting new people before she goes away to college in the fall. Hilary Mutch, who co-ordinates a GSA network in southern Alberta through the Centre for Sexuality, said isolation is one of the biggest issues for LGBTQ youth at the best of times. ""As much as possible, it's so important to think 'what are the things that we're doing to combat those feelings of isolation, lack of resources, lack of supports that people might be feeling at home, especially if their home isn't affirming or respectful of their identity?""' School divisions have approached holding GSAs during the shutdown in different ways, whether it's through email, group chats, video conferencing or social media. The Arc Foundation, which runs a program called SOGI 123 to make schools more inclusive, recently held a webinar to help educators run virtual GSAs.  More people are experiencing negativity within their unsupportive households because they're there constantly,​​​​​​.- Mav Gilchrist, 17-year-old student Scout Gray, SOGI 123's leader, said 140 people signed up — mostly in British Columbia, but some in Alberta. ""Teachers are stretched real thin right now and they're taking the time to make sure these clubs are getting running, which shows that they're really dedicated and shows that there's a need."" Gray added it's important to coach youth on privacy. For instance, if teens don't want everyone to know they're part of a GSA, they would need to think about whether having their face shown in a video chat window beamed into someone else's home is a good idea. ""We want to make sure that ... they understand that things they put out on the internet could be recorded, could be used in other places,"" Gray said. If youth don't want their families knowing, they could participate by phone during a walk around the neighbourhood so no one overhears, Gray added. Mav Gilchrist, a 17-year-old Grade 12 student in St. Albert, Alta., has noticed some students choose their words carefully or mute their mics during their GSA's Google Meet chats. Gilchrist said efforts have been made to ensure names appearing in video chat windows reflect trans students' true gender identities, which isn't always the case when accounts are linked to school-issued email addresses. Gilchrist said not as many students have been participating as usual — possibly because of scheduling or unsupportive households. But Gilchrist said it's crucial the club keep going in some form. ""More people are experiencing negativity within their unsupportive households because they're there constantly,"" Gilchrist said. ""The support that GSAs provide was vital before — it is even more vital now."" Renee LeClerc, a teacher supervisor for Gilchrist's GSA at Paul Kane High School, said students use the time to talk about whatever they want — whether that be baking, TV shows or anime. ""We are very rarely focused on LGBTQ-specific issues for an entire meeting. It is almost always just things that teenagers talk about,"" she said. ""We all just want to be in a place where we see ourselves reflected and supported.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/gay-straight-alliances-1.5553816

Here's a closer look at that research and what it might reveal.","This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.  The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spreads through droplets that we spew as we breathe, talk, cough and sneeze — so tiny that they're invisible to the naked eye.  That's why questions remain about the virus's transmission and what precautions need to be taken to curb its spread as governments begin to lift restrictions. Will it help if everyone wears a mask? Is keeping everyone two metres apart far enough? Some researchers aim to learn more about transmission by trying to make invisible sneezes, coughs and breaths more visible. Here's a closer look at that research and what it might reveal. How do scientists think COVID-19 is transmitted? According to the World Health Organization, the disease spreads primarily through tiny droplets expelled when a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 sneezes, coughs, exhales or spits while talking. They can infect another person who:   Comes into contact with those droplets through their eyes, nose or mouth (droplet transmission).   Touches objects or surfaces on which droplets have landed and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth (contact transmission).   The WHO says it's important to stay ""more than one metre away"" from a person who is sick. But the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends staying a distance of at least two metres or two arms' lengths away, not just from people who are sick but from all people you don't live with. Why is 2 metres the recommended distance for preventing transmission? Scientists in the 19th century showed respiratory droplets from a person's nose and mouth can carry micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses. Then, in 1934, W.F. Wells at the Harvard School of Public Health showed that large droplets (bigger than 0.1 millimetre) tended to fall and settle on the ground within a distance of two metres, while smaller droplets evaporated and the virus particles left behind could remain suspended in the air for a long time.  Wells proposed that could explain how diseases are transmitted. Since then, respiratory diseases have been divided into those transmitted via droplets (usually from close contact) and those that are airborne and can spread over longer distances, such as measles or tuberculosis.  INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on Saturday Such tiny particles are presumably pushed around by air currents, but can't move easily due to air resistance. So their actual movements haven't been well modelled or measured, said Lydia Bourouiba, professor and director of the Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  ""And that's why the notion of airborne [transmission] is very murky,"" said Bourouiba, who is Canadian. Why don't experts think the virus is airborne? A pair of recent studies raised the notion of airborne transmission, but Mark Loeb, a professor at Hamilton's McMaster University who specializes in infectious disease research, cautions against putting too much stock in them.  Researchers found traces of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in washrooms and some high-traffic areas in hospitals in Wuhan, China, and in Nebraska, and suggested it got into those areas through the air, though there was no evidence the particles were still infectious.  Loeb said that's just a ""signal"" that part of the virus was there.  ""Does it mean that COVID-19 is spreading from person to person through aerosols? I would say definitively not,"" Loeb said.  Government guidelines in Canada recommend that people stay at least two metres away from others as part of physical distancing measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. (Gary Moore/CBC) If the virus were airborne, we'd know by now, said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist with Sinai Health in Toronto who is leading a national research team studying how COVID-19 is transmitted. ""The reason we know that is because all around the world we have hundreds of health-care workers who are taking care of patients wearing regular masks,"" she said. ""If this were airborne —  if this were usually in those small [aerosol] particles — all those health-care workers would be getting sick."" The fact that they're not is a contrast to what would happen if the virus remained infectious in the air for hours even after an infected person left the room — which is part of what makes diseases like measles so contagious. Infection control guidelines do recommend extra personal protective equipment (including N-95 respirators) to protect against airborne transmission for health-care workers performing procedures that generate high concentrations of aerosolized particles, such as intubations, on COVID-19 patients, McGeer said.   Return to normal hinges on immunity, say those pushing for new COVID-19 blood tests But even in that scenario, the degree to which those particles are infectious hasn't been yet proven — and it a very different scenario than what people are facing in the community.  ""You and I don't have to worry walking down the street that we're going to be breathing the air of somebody who walked down the street five minutes ahead of us who had COVID-19 and didn't know it,"" said McGeer, ""That we can be confident about."" Is there evidence the virus could be spread farther than 2 metres? Some studies, including Bourouiba's, show that droplets from coughs and sneezes can, in fact, travel much farther than expected. Bourouiba's high-speed imaging measurements and modelling show smaller respiratory droplets don't behave like individual droplets but are in a turbulent gas cloud trapping them and carrying them forward within it. The moist environment reduces evaporation, allowing droplets of many sizes to survive much longer and travel much farther than two metres — up to seven or eight metres, in the case of a sneeze.  WATCH | Close-up view of the droplets released by a person sneezing  (Credit Lydia Bourouiba/MIT/JAMA Networks) She said the research ""is about revealing what you cannot see with the naked eye."" A more recent Canadian study used a ""cough chamber"" to show that if someone coughs without covering their mouth, droplets from the cough are still travelling at a speed of about one kilometre per hour when they hit the two-metre edge of the chamber. Within the chamber, droplets remained suspended for up to three minutes.  WATCH | The speed and distance travelled by droplets from a cough  Dr. Samira Mubareka, a virologist at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto who co-authored the study, said it ""gives you a sense of what the possibilities are,"" but noted that the researchers, who were studying flu patients, detected very little virus in the droplets. What does that say about the 2-metre guideline? Bourouiba says her research points to the potential for exposure beyond two metres from someone who is coughing and sneezing. As she wrote in the journal JAMA Insights in March, that means it's ""vitally important"" for health care workers to wear high-grade personal protective equipment in the form of respirators even if they're farther than two metres away from infected patients.   However, she does think two metres can be far enough for healthy people in the general public in most environments, since breathing and talking don't propel droplets and surrounding cloud too far. Mubareka stands by the two-metre guideline despite the findings of her cough chamber study. Despite dramatic images of respiratory droplets being propelled from someone's nose and mouth, it's not yet clear how many of them contain virus and how many are infectious. Second OpinionShould masks be mandatory in public to stop the spread of COVID-19? ""And that's really the key variable — that's what really determines your risk,"" she said. ""Those are the kinds of things we haven't been able to measure."" That may change, she added, with the recent invention of particle samplers designed specifically for viruses. Loeb of McMaster, notes that a cough chamber and similar laboratory setups are highly artificial settings and controlled environments. ""They're basically saying what's theoretically possible,"" he said. ""I think those are provocative and those are hypothesis- generating, but then they need to be tested in the field."" Loeb is running such a field test himself — a randomized controlled trial of the use of medical versus N95 masks among health care workers to see if there is a difference in the transmission of COVID-19. But are coughing and sneezing all we need to worry about? That's a question on a lot of people's minds, given that a growing number of studies have shown asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is possible, especially among those who live with an infected person.  Even though researchers aren't sure exactly how people without symptoms transmit the disease, the new evidence has prompted both U.S. and Canadian officials to suggest apparently healthy people wear masks in public to protect others — ""because it prevents you from breathing or speaking moistly on them,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau famously explained. ""People generate particles when they're talking, singing, breathing — so you don't have to necessarily be coughing,"" Mubareka said. ""It's just that maybe the dispersion is a little bit more limited.""  WATCH | The droplets produced when someone speaks with, and without, a mask This video, from a study published in April 2020 the New England Journal of Medicine by researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, uses laser light scattering to show droplets produced when someone speaks. 0:42  A recent brief video and report by U.S. National Institutes of Health researchers used lasers to show that droplets projected less than 10 centimetres when someone says the phrase ""Stay healthy."" It found the louder someone spoke, the more droplets were emitted. But they were dramatically reduced if a damp washcloth — a stand-in for a mask — was placed over the speaker's mouth. So what about using masks to curb the spread of COVID-19? Studies have already provided evidence that the rate at which sick people shed the virus into their surroundings is reduced when they wear a mask.  Other studies, such as a 2009 paper in Journal of the Royal Society Interface, use imaging to show how wearing a mask while coughing reduces the jet of air that's normally directed forward and down. A surgical mask ""effectively blocks the forward momentum of the cough jet and its aerosol content,"" the study found. Some does leak out the sides, top and bottom, but without much momentum. A 2009 study by researchers in the U.S. and Singapore uses schlieren imaging to show airflow from a person's mouth a) without a mask b) with a medical mask and c) with an N95 mask. (Gary S. Settles/Penn State University/Journal of the Royal Society Interface) The World Health Organization recommends that people wear masks if they are coughing and sneezing or if they are caring for someone who is sick. It notes that studies haven't been conducted yet on whether or not transmission is reduced when healthy people wear masks in public, but it encourages countries to look into that.  Many governments haven't waited. Los Angeles, Italy and Austria are among the places that have begun requiring customers to wear masks while shopping.   To read the entire Second Opinion newsletter every Saturday morning, subscribe by clicking here.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/droplet-transmission-1.5549547

The U.K. has more than 183,000 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday told the nation that Britain had passed its peak in the outbreak, and said he has plans to reveal a ""road map"" outlining how lockdown steps might be eased in the coming week.

Health Minister Olivier Veran made the announcement on Saturday, arguing that the extension of the measures that began March 24 is required to prevent a new flareup of infections. The proposal, which will be put to the French parliament next week and is expected to pass, is centred on the notion that a ""premature"" relaxing the state of emergency ""could see a risk of the outbreak"" increasing. France is among countries most affected by the pandemic, having recorded some 24,594 deaths and 167,346 confirmed cases so far. The new proposals include a data system for those that have contracted the virus, that will function for up to a year.

He says they all tested negative for the virus and have been sent to detention camps for breaching immigration laws. Rights groups have slammed the government for breaking its promise to not act against migrants who come out for virus screening. They say the inhumane move during a pandemic could hamper efforts to curb the virus's spread. Ismail brushed off the criticism Saturday, saying authorities were acting within the law. He says Malaysia has taken care of the immigrants' welfare during the lockdown, but they must face the law as they have no valid documents.

A COVID-19 glossary: What the terms mean and some subtle differencesINTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on Saturday While doctors scramble to treat patients, and local officials urge respect for social distancing measures, the Brazilian president has continued to hold political rallies. ""Bolsonaro remains one of the last standing deniers of the risk posed by the pandemic,"" said Jimena Blanco, a political risk analyst from consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. ""With the president denying the threat of the pandemic, you get a lot of people defying lockdown measures."" 'The system is collapsing' Brazil has more than 87,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 6,000 deaths, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, giving it the highest number of cases in Latin America. The actual number of cases is at least five times higher due to a lack of effective testing, especially in rural areas, said Dr. Natalia Pasternak Taschner, a medical researcher at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences in Sao Paulo. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro sits next to his wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, wearing a protective face mask, during the swearing ceremony of his new justice minister at the Planalto presidential palace in Brasilia on April 29.  (Eraldo Peres/The Associated Press) ""ICUs are breaking, the system is collapsing,"" Dr. Taschner said in a phone interview. ""It has come to the point when doctors have to choose who to give the ventilators to.""  In Manaus, a sweltering city of two million residents in the heart of the Amazon, ICUs have collapsed under the caseload, she said. Grave diggers are working double shifts to bury the bodies. Some of Brazil's struggles with the virus —  supply challenges for personal protective equipment, overwhelmed hospitals and a lack of testing capacity — aren't unique for large, diverse developing nations, public health experts said.  Health minister fired, justice minister resigns But growing political paralysis on top of the health challenges is crippling Brazil's response to COVID-19, analysts and doctors said.  WATCH | Bolsonaro downplays COVID-19 threat as Brazil's death toll rises: An infectious disease specialist says Brazil is fighting two enemies during the COVID-19 pandemic: the virus and the president. 1:53 ""It's probably the only country in the world with a major political crisis in the midst of a pandemic,"" said political scientist Oliver Stuenkel from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university in Sao Paulo. ""It's hard to imagine a worse scenario. The country is walking toward the abyss."" Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain, fired Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta on April 16.  A doctor before entering politics, Mandetta had clashed with Bolsonaro over social distancing protocols and contradicted him on the effectiveness of anti-malarial drugs in treating COVID-19.   A week later, Justice Minister Sérgio Moro resigned, accusing Bolsonaro of interfering in law enforcement after he fired the federal police chief. Jair Bolsonaro, who has downplayed coronavirus, fires Brazil's health ministerJair Bolsonaro's justice minister resigns in Brazil, accuses president of interference Moro said Bolsonaro wanted a top cop who would pass him intelligence reports during a time when his sons— politicians in congress or local city council — are under investigation for spreading fake news and money laundering. The president and his sons deny any wrongdoing.  Brazil's Supreme Court has approved an investigation into Moro's claims. Talk of impeachment is growing.  Police investigation Like his U.S. counterpart, who also downplayed the coronavirus threat and relies on family members as political confidants, Bolsonaro has faced threats of impeachment before.    But this time is different, analysts said.   ""This is the most serious crisis the Bolsonaro government has faced,"" Stuenkel said.  Volunteers from a church serve food to homeless people during a quarantine imposed by the state government to help contain the spread of the new coronavirus in Sao Paulo on April 27. (Andre Penner/The Associated Press) As the pandemic intensifies, observers warn that Bolsonaro and other lawmakers will be more concerned with partisan wrangling than with fighting COVID-19.   In a bid to secure his political future, the 65-year-old president has been approaching smaller parties in Brazil's fractious congress for support.  These groups generally don't hold a set ideology, Stuenkel said. They make deals in order to secure public sector jobs, juicy positions at government-backed development banks or other state largesse, he said. Meanwhile in Brazil: <a href=""https://t.co/MR0pKBo15Z"">pic.twitter.com/MR0pKBo15Z</a>&mdash;@Rkrahenbuhl ""These are the shady underbelly of Brazilian politics,"" he said. ""They will vote for whoever offers the most perks."" As someone who won office promising to battle nepotism and waste, this sort of backroom deal-making undermines Bolsonaro's self-described status as a political outsider and corruption fighter, Stuenkel added.  According to a public opinion poll conducted April 25 following the key cabinet departures, 46 per cent of Brazilians said Bolsonaro should resign, up from 37 per cent at the beginning of April.  Brazil using mass graves in Amazon region as coronavirus cases spike The poll from Datafolha of 1,503 people by telephone suggested Bolsonaro's response to the pandemic weighed heavily on voters' minds. Nearly half of the respondents, 45 per cent, said he was doing a bad or terrible job of handling COVID-19 while 27 per cent said he has done a good or excellent job.  The poll suggested about one-third of voters support the president. ""Irrespective of whether Bolsanaro falls or not, the country will be absorbed by a political crisis,"" Stuenkel said. ""This will drastically reduce its capacity to respond to the pandemic."" Social inequality While politicians jostle over impeachment, many Brazilians aren't able to follow social distancing guidelines advised by health experts.  ""Social inequalities are a huge problem,"" said Dr. Anya Vieira-Meyer, a public health researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a government-linked organization in the northeastern city of Fortaleza. ""That also impacts the spread of the coronavirus.""  When the virus first arrived in Brazil, it was transported by middle- and upper-class Brazilians coming home from Europe, she said.  Since then, it has spread quickly into densely packed working-class neighbourhoods, where access to infrastructure can be precarious.   About 11 million Brazilians live in houses with more than three people per room and 16 per cent don't have access to clean water at home, Vieira-Meyer said, making social distancing or regular hand-washing difficult.  A friend pours beer on the coffin of a woman who died from the new coronavirus in Rio de Janeiro on April 28. (Leo Correa/The Associated Press) For workers in the country's vast informal sector, staying home can mean going hungry, she said, and having the president flouting social distancing advice doesn't make the job of doctors any easier.  In Sao Paulo, about half of the population has been following social distancing guidelines, Taschner said. Local officials are hoping to increase that to at least 70 per cent.  Deaths doubling every 8 days The federal government has failed in its responsibility to safeguard citizens, but some state and local officials have been trying, Taschner said. However, the growth in registered cases is still exponential, she said, and the country is nowhere near its peak.  ""We are doubling the number of cases every 10 days, and the number of deaths is doubling in eight days.""  Unlike other developing nations, Brazil offers free universal public health care, Vieira-Meyer said, but the system is strongest in the big cities. For now, that's where most of the cases have been concentrated.  Bolsonaro, left, talks with Vice-President Hamilton Mourao during the swearing-in ceremony of new Justice Minister Andre Luiz de Almeida Mendonca, at the Planalto presidential palace, in Brasilia on April 29. (Eraldo Peres/The Associated Press) More than two-thirds of municipalities in the country of 210 million haven't reported cases of the virus, Vieira-Meyer said, but that could simply be due to a lack of testing.  When it spreads into those smaller towns, far from hospitals with ICUs or ventilators, health officials worry the situation will be disastrous.  ""The situation is going to get much worse,"" said Dr. Taschner.

(Peter Cziborra/Reuters) How COVID-19 could change the way cities look and operate While some cities have eased lockdown restrictions, physical distancing measures that health officials say are crucial to halting the spread of COVID-19 will likely be with us for months, if not longer. They are already having an effect on activity levels and the flow of cities, writes CBC's Andre Mayer, while planners, architects and designers are seeing changes both in Canada and around the world that could become permanent. Every major calamity, from the 19th-century cholera outbreaks to the 2013 floods in Calgary, has provided valuable lessons in better city-building, said John Brown, dean of the school of architecture, planning and landscape at the University of Calgary. But COVID-19 poses a unique challenge. Ensuring people have access to transit, shopping amenities and fresh air, all while maintaining a two-metre distance, is difficult in high-density areas. As a result of our collective self-isolation, there are fewer cars on the road. At the same time, people are seeking respite outdoors by walking. But it is increasingly challenging to maintain a respectful distance on sidewalks without veering into traffic. Some municipalities are taking bold action to address this. Last week, the Italian city of Milan announced a plan to transform 35 kilometres of streets to expand cycling and walking space. In reducing car capacity, it will have the dual effect of providing a safe outlet for walkers and reducing air pollution. Berlin, Budapest and Mexico City are just some of the cities proposing similar measures. Public transit is also a crucial element of any cityscape, as many people can't rely on a car to get around. Most cities are reporting a drop in public transit use during the pandemic, and it's likely to remain lower than usual in the short term, said Ahsan Habib, director of the school of planning at Dalhousie University. During the pandemic, U.S. cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and Denver have made several adjustments to their transit systems, including suspending fares and allowing rear-door boarding. Habib said ultimately, cities must invest in ways to make buses and streetcars less prone to crowding. The pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of letting a large part of the labour force work from home. While not everyone can telecommute, enough people are able to do so that it could reduce demand for physical offices, which could in turn affect the proliferation of highrise buildings. Brown, who also runs a Calgary-based architecture firm called Housebrand, said telecommuting may also have an impact on the layout of homes, as residents seek to carve out discrete corners in even the tiniest condo suite to have a private Zoom meeting.

Plus in this extended edition, the panellists weigh in on the return of the Conservative leadership race. 16:16 IN BRIEF Canada is officially in a recession because of the pandemic, C.D. Howe says Canada is officially in a recession that's been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the C.D. Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council declared today. The council, which monitors recessions and recoveries in Canada, said the economy peaked in February, just before drastic measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus were implemented across the country. There are no hard and fast rules for declaring a recession, although one rule of thumb used by economists is that an economy is probably in one if it has shrunk for two three-month periods in a row. The council rejects the ""two quarters"" rule and instead defines a recession as a ""pronounced, persistent and pervasive decline in aggregate economic activity"" based largely on GDP and the job market. The COVID-19 pandemic is still less than two months old in Canada, but the council said that the slowdown is already so swift and deep that it's safe to declare a recession already. In the council's view, this is the first recession Canada has seen since the financial crisis that began in 2008 — and the data suggests this one is on track to be quite a bit worse than that one. While the decline in March was record-setting, economists expect the data for April will show an even bigger drop, with the measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus in place for the entire month. Read more about Canada's economic situation  Ontario allows some businesses to reopen Monday, while Alberta's plan begins Saturday The Ontario government announced today that it's allowing a limited number of businesses to reopen, as long as they meet ""strict public health measures."" Lawn care and landscaping services, garden centres and nurseries with curbside pickup, community gardens, automatic and self-serve car washes, auto dealers, and some construction projects will be allowed to open on Monday, with specific rules around how they can operate. ""Today's news shows us if we stay the course, if we stay vigilant and take the measured approach, we can keep moving in the right direction,"" Premier Doug Ford said at a news briefing. In Alberta, meanwhile, Premier Jason Kenney detailed his government's plan for a multi-stage relaunch that will depend on the province's continued ability to control the spread of the coronavirus and curb the number of COVID-19 patients who need hospital care. The first step in Alberta's plan to reopen its economy will emphasize outdoor activities, with golf courses to open Saturday, followed by shops, bars and restaurants by mid-May. Parts of the gradual relaunch plan, which Kenney announced Thursday, will begin Monday with the resumption of some non-urgent surgeries and office reopenings for dentists, physiotherapists and other professionals. Schools will remain closed until the end of the academic year, with instruction continuing online, but Kenney said the province is in discussions with school boards ""about allowing some limited reopening on a trial basis"" for summer classes and specialized programs. Read more about what's happening across Canada  Air Canada anticipates return of worldwide air travel by Christmas An Air Canada vice-president suggested that by the time winter holidays roll around again, Canadians will be able to board his company's planes and fly almost anywhere in the world. But Tim Strauss said he knows that one of the biggest tasks involved in bringing air travel back to life after pandemic restrictions lift will be convincing the public it's safe to fly. The airline industry has been hammered by the pandemic. Some Canadian airlines have stopped flying entirely while others, including Air Canada, have scaled back more than 90 per cent because of the dramatic drop in demand. At a virtual Canadian Club Toronto event today, executives at several major airlines talked about what the North American airline industry could look like post-pandemic. Air Canada, Sunwing and American Airlines said corporate conversations about post-pandemic operations are focused on making sure planes are kept clean. Some airlines are changing how often they sanitize their planes and are even considering changes to how air is circulated in passenger cabins. Transport Canada has made it mandatory for all passengers to wear masks while on board and in airports when they cannot physically distance two metres from others. While Air Canada predicts better times for the industry by Christmas, airline analyst Helane Becker points out that other countries will need to lift their pandemic restrictions and reopen their economies first in order to convince people to travel. ""We need to get all these governments on the same page to kind of open things up. Everyone wants it to be done safely because no one wants the recurrence of cases,"" Becker said Read more about the pandemic's impact on air travel   THE SCIENCE Is Canada looking into using remdesivir? CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions about the COVID-19 pandemic, including this one. If you have a question of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: The U.S. is fast-tracking approval of the antiviral drug remdesivir to help treat COVID-19. Top U.S. health official Dr. Anthony Fauci said it has a ""clear cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,"" after favourable results of a clinical trial. Remdesivir, which impairs the coronavirus's ability to replicate, was initially used to treat Ebola, but is not officially approved for use in Canada. Yet, some hospitals are getting access to it through ""individual compassionate use."" What does this mean? Health Canada has a program that allows particular, unapproved drugs to be used in unique cases. Health Canada said the maker of remdesivir, Gilead, is transitioning to this ""provision of emergency access"" but can no longer accept more requests because of ""an overwhelming demand."" In an email to CBC News, Gilead said it is ramping up production but did not specify how much remdesivir would be sent to Canada. AND FINALLY...

Stead expected 20 to 30 kids to sign up for the live painting class, but now her group has more than 1,500 members from all over the country — and many families have more than one child participating. Stead was inspired after painting helped her get through ""a nasty cancer."" Two years ago, Stead was diagnosed with breast cancer, which involved chemo, radiation and a double mastectomy. Stead said art got her through the treatments; when she couldn't get off the sofa, she challenged herself to do a painting a day for 100 days. ""My breast cancer and my treatment brought me to a place where everybody else is right now — a place of uncertainty, of being isolated. I had no immune system,"" she said. ""When school was cancelled, I knew how everybody was going to feel and that prompted me to get moving.""

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) As of 7:30 p.m. ET on Friday, Canada had 55,061 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases, with the majority concentrated in Ontario and Quebec. Provinces and territories list 22,762 of the cases as resolved or recovered. A CBC News tally of COVID-19-related deaths based on provincial data, regional health information and CBC's reporting lists 3,507 deaths in Canada and two known coronavirus-related deaths of Canadians abroad.  In 2 weeks, this Alberta city went from just a few cases of COVID-19 to the province's biggest hotspot Ontario to allow some businesses to reopen, long-term care outbreaks continue to climb  Public health officials have cautioned that the recorded numbers are likely too low, noting that they fail to capture information on people who have not been tested or who are still under investigation as possible coronavirus cases. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, has urged people to behave as though there is coronavirus in their community, even if there haven't been any recorded cases.  The novel coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. There is no proven treatment or vaccine for the virus, which first emerged in China in late 2019.  What's happening in the provinces and territories Police in British Columbia have made hundreds of home visits to make sure residents who recently returned home from abroad are following self-isolation orders. The visits were to roughly 500 people who had not responded to phone calls and text messages from authorities making sure recent travellers were quarantining as promised. Read more about what's happening in B.C.

People in Louisiana could eat at restaurants again but had to sit outside at tables three metres apart with no waiter service. Maine residents could attend church services as long as they stayed in their cars. And a Nebraska mall reopened with Plexiglas barriers and hand-sanitizing stations but few shoppers. Meanwhile, the first drug shown to help fight COVID-19 won emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In a major study, remdesivir shortened patients' recovery time from 15 days to 11 on average and may have also reduced deaths. Shoppers wearing face masks enter a department store in Omaha, Neb., on Friday. (Nati Harnik/The Associated Press) President Donald Trump said Friday that he's hoping the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States will be below 100,000, which he acknowledged is a ""horrible number."" Trump's predictions of the expected U.S. death toll have changed over time, with his earlier 60,000 projection now being eclipsed. But he said at a White House event that ""maybe millions of lives"" have been saved by shutting down the economy. More than 64,000 people have died in the U.S. so far. With the crisis stabilizing in Europe and in many places in the U.S., countries and states are gradually easing their restrictions amid warnings from health experts that a second wave of infections could hit unless testing for the virus is expanded dramatically.

Wyoming let barbershops, nail salons, gyms and daycare centres reopen. In Maine, golf courses, hairdressers and dentists opened. Hotels near South Carolina beaches opened and state parks unlocked their gates for the first time in more than a month. But in Myrtle Beach, the state's most popular tourist destination, hotel elevators will be restricted to one person or one family — a potential inconvenience at the area's 15- and 20-storey resorts.

In Washington state, where the nation's first COVID-19 case was confirmed in January, Gov. Jay Inslee said Friday that he is extending the state's coronavirus stay-at-home order through at least May 31 and that he will ease the restrictions in four stages. Washington also had the first deadly cluster of cases in the U.S., at a Seattle-area nursing home. What's happening around the world From The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 3:45 p.m. ET Countries must lift lockdowns gradually, while still being ""on the look-out"" for COVID-19 and ready to restore restrictions if the virus jumps back, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday. Vulnerable people in institutions, including those in long-term care facilities, prisons and migrant dormitories, must be protected, said Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergencies expert. Even if the virus is coming under control, communities must know to still follow physical distancing and hygiene measures, and testing of suspect cases must continue, he said.

But experts say that while the WHO may have made some missteps in its handling of the crisis, the organization is only as powerful as its weakest link. INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on Saturday The United Nations agency was founded in 1948 with a mandate to act as an authority on international health.  Its 194 member states fund the agency and set Its policies, and it is accountable to them. Conversely, it has discretionary power to investigate members' handling of public health crises, but it relies on their co-operation and information sharing. ""An organization like the World Health Organization can only be as strong and as effective as its member states want it to be,"" said Steven Hoffman, director of the Global Strategy Lab and a global health law professor at York University in Toronto.  ""So, one of the challenges that the World Health Organization has faced over the last decades is that it keeps on getting new responsibilities and no new resources."" In 2005, its responsibilities increased with the adoption of the International Health Regulations (IHR), a legal agreement signed by all members that requires countries to report emerging disease outbreaks that are at risk of spreading worldwide.  WATCH | WHO defends its record on COVID-19 The World Health Organization has defended its handling of the coronavirus outbreak after President Donald Trump orders withdrawal of U.S. funding for the organization. 2:55 In doing so, experts say the WHO took on a more political role in juggling the domestic interests of its individual members with the interests of the rest of the world. ""They have never performed well in that function — not once,"" said Amir Attaran, a professor in the Faculties of Law and School of Epidemiology and Public Health at the University of Ottawa, who told CBC's Sunday Edition the WHO should never again preside over a pandemic.  ""They cave to diplomatic pressure. Or even if there is not diplomatic pressure, they self-censor.""  Attaran said an agency entrusted with ensuring compliance with an agreement like the IHR cannot also operate with the ""attitude of a diplomat.""  Tedros shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a meeting in Beijing on Jan. 28. Amir Attaran says the WHO will consistently 'cave to diplomatic pressure.' (Naohiko Hatta/Reuters) ""It cannot simultaneously be constantly begging countries for co-operation in certain areas where it's expected at the next moment to turn on them severely and possibly fault them for hiding an epidemic.""  Hoffman says the agency is ""doomed by its institutional design."" China announces additional $30M in funding for WHO ""The criticisms that WHO has faced are not fair in the sense that WHO is not an independent entity, it's essentially acting on behalf of its member states, who control it,"" he said.  ""So, the criticism is really a criticism of those national governments' inability to create the kind of strong public health agency that the world needs in this globalized era.""  Early response to pandemic criticized On Dec. 31, China alerted the WHO to a mysterious outbreak of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, in the central Chinese province of Hubei.  But it would be weeks before the WHO declared the situation a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Jan. 30, a key designation that determines whether a country's response to an outbreak has been effective and if more resources are needed.  The timing of that emergency declaration is critical at the beginning of an epidemic and can have ripple effects on how quickly countries around the world respond.  China didn't warn public of likely pandemic for 6 crucial days ""I think that happened probably a week too late,"" said Hoffman, adding that the organization was ""hung"" over whether the outbreak constituted an emergency.  While the WHO considered the emergency declaration, Chinese officials acted swiftly to silence early informal releases of information from health care workers sounding the alarm in Wuhan, opting instead to carefully manage the release of information in the weeks before the WHO would be allowed on the ground.  Former Canadian ambassador to China David Mulroney said that information was put through a ""political prism"" in China and delayed as local officials determined how to put the best possible face on the crisis before sending it up the line to Beijing.  ""You never want to give bad news to your boss in China,"" he said.  Health care workers attend to COVID-19 patients at the intensive care unit of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, on Feb. 6. The WHO was quick to praise China for its efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak but has been criticized for not declaring a public health emergency of international concern quickly enough. (China Daily/Reuters) Mulroney said that problem highlights an inherent issue within the WHO: it can be ""stonewalled"" by a member country on the release of information — posing a ""significant risk"" at a critical time in an outbreak. Lynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto and a China specialist, said the WHO needed to maintain a diplomatic relationship with China in order to encourage the conducting of investigations and the sharing of key data.  When Chinese health officials quickly genetically sequenced the virus from an infected patient, the WHO lauded the effort, calling it a ""notable achievement"" that ""demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks."" CBC InvestigatesWhy some experts are questioning China's coronavirus claims ""But you do not also want to overdo it, to be too deferential and too friendly to the extent that you cannot take a step back and then question the things that they share with you,"" she said.  ""WHO is being criticized, rightly so, and a lot of the criticism is justified to my mind because they have probably gone a little too far to the other side of being too deferential.""  Ong said that while the WHO was ""outwardly praising"" China for its capacity to build hospitals and put in place strict lockdown of millions of its citizens that helped flatten their epidemic curve, the country did so by casting aside privacy and human rights with Draconian restrictions on citizens. Health care workers walk a patient into a hospital in Wuhan on Jan. 27. Former interim Liberal leader and Canada's special envoy on humanitarian and refugee issues Bob Rae says there is no evidence to suggest the WHO actively suppressed the release of any information on the pandemic. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) ""The other side of the criticism, which I also think is justified, is the cover-up at the beginning, which I don't think the WHO has actually addressed at all,"" she said, adding the world lost two to three weeks at a ""very crucial time"" in tackling the outbreak. ""Had there not been any cover-up, I think the world probably, we would be in a different position.""  Should the WHO be held accountable?  Calls for the WHO to be held accountable for its response to the global coronavirus have been been growing. Australia says it will call for an international investigation into the origin of the pandemic at next month's annual meeting of the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the WHO. And U.S. President Donald Trump has already cut funding to the organization, saying it ""failed"" in its duty.  Still, the U.S. is working with the agency. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has, since late January, had a member on the WHO's emergency committee, which also includes Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam as an adviser.  Tam said that while she would welcome a review of the pandemic advice provided by the WHO, she does not fault it for its initial response because health experts all over the world ""underestimated where this could go.""  WATCH | Dr. Theresa Tam says it would be 'worthwhile to examine' the WHO's response to COVID-19 In an exclusive interview, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam tells CBC’s chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton that health experts underestimated the global COVID-19 spread and that it would be ""worthwhile to examine"" the World Health Organization's response. 1:29 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would continue to work with the WHO because the virus ""demands a global, co-ordinated response."" He added there will be ""plenty of time to reflect on challenges"" in the future. Former interim Liberal leader Bob Rae and Canada's special envoy on humanitarian and refugee issues said that while the WHO does act as a source of information, alert and guidance for countries in a pandemic, that doesn't take away the responsibility of governments to take the steps they feel necessary.  Wuhan health officials raise death toll linked to COVID-19 by 50% ""You could never say, 'Well, you know, [the WHO] didn't tell us how serious it was.' Of course they did,"" Rae said. ""The question as to how each country should respond to the information is entirely up to each country. It's not up to the WHO."" The WHO doesn't issue directives ""to say you should carry out a lockdown, you should limit transportation, you should cut off all flights."" Rae said that while it can be difficult for the WHO to navigate the challenges of the Chinese political system, there's no evidence to suggest the organization actively suppressed the release of any information on the pandemic. He says the criticism of the WHO is ""completely misguided"" and that cutting funding to the organization at a critical time is a strategic ""mistake.""  ""I think every crisis such as this one will prompt every governmental agency, both domestic and international, to reflect on what happened and to see how it can be improved,"" he said.

The protest appeared to be the largest in the state since April 15, when supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump organized thousands of people for ""Operation Gridlock,"" jamming the streets of Lansing with their cars to call out what they said was the overreach of Whitmer's strict stay-at-home order.

Exercising right to freedom of speech State authorities have warned that protesters could be ticketed for violating physical distancing rules. The mayor of Lansing, Andy Schor, said in a statement on Wednesday that he was ""disappointed"" protesters would put themselves and others at risk, but recognized that Whitmer's order still allowed people to ""exercise their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.""

The USNS Comfort hospital ship leaves New York City after the last patient aboard was discharged earlier this week. (Justin Heiman/Getty Images) Questions about outdoor COVID-19 transmission risks grow as weather improves As millions of Canadians eye the imminent arrival of better weather and feel the effects of six weeks stuck largely at home, some are wondering whether spending more time outdoors is a risk worth taking. Research about the likelihood of outdoor transmission of the virus is virtually non-existent. While crowded outdoor spaces pose a clear risk of infection, there is little doubt that COVID-19 spreads far more easily indoors than outdoors. The competing priorities of urging people to stay at home to prevent infections and the mental health costs of spending too much time indoors, mixed with the unclear risks of outdoor transmission, have public health officials struggling to craft a clear and consistent message. B.C.'s provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, told people in her province on Wednesday to go outdoors. ""The risk [of catching the virus] would be infinitesimally small if somebody walks by you, runs by you — even if they are within six feet,"" she said. Her Ontario counterpart was less definitive; Dr. David Williams said it's important that people who go outside do so in ways that allow for physical distancing. ""Don't go to places where you think everybody else is going to go. Don't go at hours when everybody else is going,"" he said. While evidence about outdoor transmission of the virus is lacking, research ""has consistently shown that transmission is strongly dependent on being in close proximity to a sick person for some period of time,"" the National Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health said. The centre, a Vancouver-based team of researchers funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada, is sounding caution about the negative effects of limiting people's access to the outdoors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of making more outdoor space available, Toronto is lessening it by shutting its largest park starting today. The closure of High Park is to prevent crowds from gathering around groves of cherry trees to view their blossoms. Dr. Eileen De Villa, Toronto's medical officer of health, has rejected calls that the city close downtown streets to traffic to free up more room for pedestrians, saying it could encourage people to congregate on the closed streets.

Physically prohibited from being with their loved ones in their final moments, they are saying goodbye on phones, screens or, in some cases, not at all. The story of COVID-19 in Canada is more than a graph. Each of those data points represents a hole in the lives of a Canadian family who are now forced to mourn at a distance. For several weeks, a team of CBC journalists has been keeping track of those who died, trying to find out as much as we can about who these people were in an effort to tell their stories. Unlike many other countries, Canada has an incomplete picture of the toll of COVID-19, writes CBC News editor in chief Brodie Fenlon​​​​. As part of the Lives Remembered project, CBC News is setting out to learn who is being disproportionately affected and to help everyone understand how to deal with this pandemic in the months ahead. If you would like your loved one's information included in our data set, please email covid-data@cbc.ca. Read more stories from the Lives Remembered project  Did the WHO mishandle the global coronavirus pandemic? The World Health Organization has come under fire for its response to the global coronavirus pandemic, with threats of funding cuts and investigations into its conduct. But experts say that while the WHO may have made some missteps in its handling of the crisis, the organization is only as powerful as its weakest link. In 2005, the WHO's responsibilities increased with the adoption of the International Health Regulations (IHR), a legal agreement signed by all members that requires countries to report emerging disease outbreaks that are at risk of spreading worldwide. In doing so, experts say the WHO took on a more political role in juggling the domestic interests of its individual members with the interests of the rest of the world. ""They have never performed well in that function — not once,"" said Amir Attaran, a professor in the faculties of law and school of epidemiology and public health at the University of Ottawa. While the WHO considered an emergency declaration in January, Chinese officials acted swiftly to silence early informal releases of information from health-care workers sounding the alarm in Wuhan. ""You never want to give bad news to your boss in China,"" said former Canadian ambassador to China David Mulroney. He said that highlights an inherent issue within the WHO: it can be ""stonewalled"" by a member country on the release of information — posing a ""significant risk"" at a critical time in an outbreak.

Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Janice Fitzgerald unveiled the provincial government's five-stage plan for relaxing public health restrictions, including conditions that need to be met as the province progresses from present conditions — what it calls Level 5 — to living with COVID-19 — Level 1. The government's alert system comes as the province marks the fourth straight day with no new COVID-19 cases. Effective today, Newfoundland and Labrador residents can expand their household ""bubble"" — the immediate group people live and interact with under public health restrictions — to one other household to interact with, provided the other household agrees. Each household can interact only with each other. The provincial government has set May 11 as the target date for moving to Level 4, provided several conditions, are met, including widely available testing and capacity in the health system to handle the caseload. Should the conditions be met, Level 4 includes the relaxation of restrictions on low-risk outdoor recreational activities, low-risk non-essential businesses and the resumption of some medical procedures in regional health authorities. No target date has been set for Level 3 or lower.

CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions about the COVID-19 pandemic, including this one. If you have a question of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: Right now, evidence strongly suggests the antibodies we are producing do indeed provide us with some sort of immunity, according to Matthew Miller, associate professor in the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University. ""The real questions are for how long does that protection last,"" he said. ""I think that's sort of a bigger issue."" Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious diseases specialist at the University Health Network, agreed. ""I believe we will make a vaccine for this and that the antibodies that people produce will very likely provide some level of protection. The question is how much protection and for how long."" Bogoch said doctors and scientists are focusing on the lifespan of the antibodies because the coronavirus does in fact mutate. That means antibodies you created to fight off the virus the first time you are exposed may not be effective the next time. But Miller added that antibodies aren't the only part of your immune system that protects you from the virus. ""There are also these cells called T-cells and they can help provide protection as well,"" he said. ""It's kind of a mixture of antibodies and T-cells that do the work for your immune system in order to protect it."" AND FINALLY... Teachers in Steinbach, Man., surprise graduating students at their homes With social isolation, teachers say they wanted to give the students a pick-me-up so the school organized the early morning surprise to celebrate the graduating class. 1:35 Grade 12 students from Steinbach Regional Secondary School in southeastern Manitoba woke up to a big surprise Wednesday, as some of their teachers showed up with lawn signs saying ""congratulations."" With the school's normal graduation activities postponed for now because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the school organized the early morning gesture to celebrate the graduating class. ""I think our grads need a pick-me-up. It's been tough work for them at home, being distanced from their friends and normal routine,"" said Sherry Bestvater, co-principal of the school. The teachers started decorating their cars early in the morning with yellow ribbons and balloons and banners displaying the school's logo, the sabre, on them.

Soon, the city may run out of coffins. Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, was the first in Brazil to run out of intensive care units, but officials warned that several other cities are close behind as the country registered a record 6,276 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday. Brazil's Health Ministry on Thursday reported 435 related deaths in the prior 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 5,901 out of 85,380 confirmed cases. In Rio de Janeiro, cemeteries have accelerated construction of above-ground vaults to entomb a wave of deceased patients. Undertakers in Manaus even resorted to burying coffins one on top of the other this week, but the city stopped the practice after grieving relatives protested. Brazilians tend to the grave of a loved one at Parque Taruma cemetery in Manaus. (Bruno Kelly/Reuters) Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has downplayed the gravity of the virus, calling it a ""little cold,"" came under new criticism for his remarks on the soaring deaths. ""So what? I'm sorry, but what do you want me to do?"" Bolsonaro told reporters on Tuesday, saying he could not ""work miracles."" The accelerating death rate in Brazil is the most concerning of all emerging-market countries, Deutsche Bank analysts told clients in a note on Wednesday. In Manaus, which is accessible only by plane or boat from the rest of Brazil, corpses are accumulating in a refrigerated container improvised as a morgue freezer as they await burial. At the main Taruma cemetery, a new area has been opened where undertakers were digging rows of graves and now just trenches for five coffins at a time. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, left, has seen his justice and health ministers depart this month. In the event that Bolsonaro were to be removed from office, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao, right, would likely take the helm.   (Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters) The mayor's office said the city's funeral system was collapsing and running out of coffins. Only two relatives are allowed to attend burials, and sometimes there is nobody to accompany the coffins to the grave. The city is recommending that families cremate their dead. Pot-banging protests Bolsonaro's response to the crisis is one of the reasons most polls have seen his support sag. He fired his health minister two weeks ago and in some parts of the country citizens bang pots out of their windows in the evening in a symbolic protest. ""It's time to talk. The president is digging his grave,"" former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso wrote on Twitter on Friday. ""He should resign before he is forced to resign. Save us, in addition to coronavirus, from having a long impeachment process."" Bolsonaro also saw his justice minister resign last week. Sergio Moro alleged that the president was looking to interfere in police investigations and looking to tap an ally to lead the federal police. Bolsonaro was forced to withdraw the choice on Wednesday after the country's top court blocked the pick. The Supreme Court authorized an investigation into allegations by Bolsonaro's former justice minister that the president had abused his power by swapping the police chief.

The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the clearinghouse for the web of U.S. spy agencies, comes as U.S. President Donald Trump and his allies have speculated about the as-yet-unproven theory that an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, the epicentre of the Chinese outbreak, was the source of the global pandemic that has killed more than 220,000 people worldwide. In recent days, the Trump administration has sharpened its rhetoric on China, accusing the geopolitical foe and vital trading partner of failing to act swiftly enough to sound the alarm to the world about the outbreak or to stop the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. The new ODNI statement says, ""The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified."" ""The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan."" 'All available evidence' suggests COVID-19 had animal origin and wasn't produced in lab — WHONo, the new coronavirus wasn't created in a lab, scientists say ""The mere fact that we don't know the answers — that China hasn't shared the answers — I think is very, very telling,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said recently. Trump on Thursday took it a step further, suggesting the release could have been intentional, reflecting another occasion in which he's clashed with U.S. intelligence, which occurred most notably on the subject of Russian interference in the 2016 election. ""It's a terrible thing that happened,"" the president said Thursday at the White House. ""Whether they made a mistake or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose."" Pompeo brings up proximity to wet market Pompeo has pressed China to let outside experts into the lab ""so that we can determine precisely where this virus began."" While Trump and Pompeo have made public statements speculating about the lab, a U.S. intelligence official disputed the notion that there was any pressure on agencies to bolster a particular theory. The intelligence official was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue and spoke only on condition of anonymity. The agency has not had a Senate-confirmed director since Dan Coats stepped down last year, with Joseph Maguire and now Richard Grenell filling in on an interim basis. Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas, one of the Trump's most loyal defenders during the impeachment process, has been nominated to succeed Coats, with a Senate confirmation hearing tentatively scheduled for next week when the Senate reconvenes. Scientists say the virus arose naturally in bats. Even so, Pompeo and others have pointed fingers at an institute that is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It has done groundbreaking research tracing the likely origins of the SARS virus, finding new bat viruses and discovering how they could jump to people. ""We know that there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology just a handful of miles away from where the wet market was,"" Pompeo said two weeks ago. The institute has an address 13 kilometres from the market that is considered a possible source. Virus 'should be studied by scientists': Beijing U.S. officials say the American Embassy in Beijing flagged concerns about potential safety issues at the lab in Wuhan in 2018, but they have yet to find any evidence the virus originated there nearly two years later. The Chinese government said Thursday that any claims that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory are ""unfounded and purely fabricated out of nothing."" Did the WHO mishandle the global coronavirus pandemic?The DoseWhy does a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic give rise to conspiracy theories? Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang cited the institute's director, Yuan Zhiming, as saying the lab strictly implements bio-security procedures that would prevent the release of any pathogen. ""I would like to point out again that the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue, and it should be studied by scientists and professionals,"" Geng said. Geng also criticized U.S. politicians who have suggested China should be held accountable for the global pandemic, saying they should spend their time on ""better controlling the epidemic situation at home."" But a Chinese government spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, demonstrated that China was not above sowing confusion in the face of the pandemic.

Global energy demand could slump by six per cent in 2020 because of the restrictions placed on homes and industry in what would be the largest contraction in absolute terms on record, according to Paris-based IEA, which advises industrialized nations on energy. The slump would lead to a drop in carbon dioxide emissions of eight per cent, six times larger than the biggest fall of 400 million tonnes recorded in 2009 following the global financial crisis, according to the IEA, which described its estimate as conservative.

Those are extremely low numbers compared with the experience of western Europe. Still, many doctors — even those sympathetic to the government — have told CBC News part of the challenge is that Russia's tests return an unusually large number of false negative results.

Instead, she spent her final moments gasping for air during a panic attack in a nursing home, with COVID-19 preventing her loved ones from being by her side.","Jennifer Patrick was terrified of dying alone.  The 65-year-old was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis nearly two years ago. She relied on progressively higher and higher concentrations of oxygen and a few months ago was moved to a Calgary nursing home.  Since the diagnosis, Britt Patrick said her mom just kept repeating her fear — ""I don't want to die alone."" But two days after she contracted COVID-19 that's exactly what happened. On April 19, the 65-year-old from Airdrie, Alta., was having a panic attack, gasping for air. She hadn't seen a friend or family member in days. It was her husband's birthday. They'd spent the last 41 years together but hadn't seen each other since the Calgary home, Extendicare Hillcrest, was locked down to visitors. Her daughter and grandchildren were two provinces away. Her nurse, who was sitting by her bedside, left the room to get morphine to ease her panicked gasps for air. When the nurse returned, Jennifer Patrick was gone.  ""It was very, very surreal,"" Britt Patrick said. ""I feel like maybe my dad should have been allowed in with proper protection just to say goodbye."" No chance to say goodbye Patrick said her mom's COVID-19 diagnosis didn't come as a shock. The Winnipeg resident knew Calgary was experiencing high numbers of COVID-19 cases, and said she had an ominous feeling, knowing her mom already had a serious respiratory illness. But the speed of her mom's death, without a chance to say goodbye, left her reeling. She doesn't even remember what they talked about during their last phone call — the oxygen deprivation had increasingly made talking on the phone difficult for her mom. ""That's frustrating and that's hard,"" she said. ""I know I ended up missing a phone call with her. I had been trying to get ahold of her for quite a while and I finally got a phone call back. I was just getting out the door and I didn't have time to answer it and I wish I'd taken that two minutes to take that conversation."" She also doesn't know what to tell her three children. ""They're struggling with it, they're asking, 'When can we go out there? Are we going to the funeral?' They're asking very obvious questions for children that I can't answer and that's frustrating, to not be able to let them know when we can visit Grampy, when we can do these things,"" she said. Dying alone all too common during pandemic While Patrick may feel alone in her grief, tens of thousands of families globally are facing the same harsh reality — forced to say goodbye through a video call or being deprived of even that small connection, due to precautions in place or personal safety decisions made to avoid spreading the infectious disease. University of Alberta nursing professor Donna Wilson studies end-of-life care, bereavement and what it means to have a good death. She said while initially many of us were taken by surprise by the pandemic, now that it has been the reality for months, it's time to find better ways to let people say goodbye. ""There has to be a way around this,"" Wilson said.  If a family member thinks it wasn't a good death ... they may have seriously complicated grief.- Donna Wilson, University of Alberta nursing professor Wilson said the deathbed goodbye — where loved ones gather around a dying person's bedside to make amends, and express sentiments that may have previously gone unsaid — is a centuries-old custom for a reason. ""People don't want to be alone, they want to be surrounded by their family members, the people that really mean something to them … it's really important because people have the opportunity to say something to the dying person that maybe they never said before."" She said international research has shown that a good death, which is somewhat expected, largely free from suffering, and in accordance with a patient or their family's wishes, is vital to the grieving process for those left behind. ""If the family member thinks it wasn't a good death … they grieve harder and longer and they may never get over the death, they may have seriously complicated grief,"" she said. The families of people who died after getting COVID-19 are sharing the stories of their loved ones to encourage others to do what they can to prevent further spread of the coronavirus. 2:05 That's the situation Britt Patrick finds herself in.  ""You have people who are passing away afraid and alone, why can't we at least set something up to allow people to say goodbye safely?"" she said.  Michael Bittante, the regional director for Extendicare, said while Jennifer Patrick's family was contacted and informed of her condition, end-of-life visits are not always feasible. ""We continue to provide end-of-life visitation with families when possible, using personal protective equipment and infection control measures. Unfortunately, this is not always possible for a number of reasons, including the progression of a resident's illness,"" he said.  CBC News reached out to Extendicare to clarify the timeline as to when residents are allowed end-of-life visitors, and the company reiterated that it is following provincial directives. Donna Wilson said it's important for the government or health officials to step in, as they did to limit visitors to nursing homes, to ensure end-of-life visits happen. ""We're looking at a lot of people that are going to be really severely damaged if they're blocked from the deathbed,"" she said. Wilson suggested strategies like bringing in retired nurses to facilitate visits and assist visitors with donning protective equipment, or arranging for visits to be held in private rooms near the entrances of buildings or even in ambulances, that can be cleaned after each visit.  ""If you can get a nurse in and out of a hospital safely … you can bring a relative in and out safely."" Some end-of-life policies were applied too strictly Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said Wednesday that she knows the protective measures in place at long-term care facilities are causing many residents to feel increasingly isolated and said some end-of-life visitation policies were being applied more strictly than intended. ""There have been some interpretations where some believed the intention of the order was [to only allow visits] in the last few hours of life ... it's very difficult to arrange for visits in that very narrow window,"" she said.  ""We expect that individuals who are dying must have the opportunity to have their loved ones at their side."" She said up to two visitors can be allowed to see those estimated to be two weeks away from death, as long as they maintain two metres of physical distance. New COVID-19 public health order intended to ensure no Albertan has to die alone While that update doesn't change anything for Britt Patrick, she's learned one thing in her grief she wants to share. ""Just take every chance to connect with your loved ones."" There were 503 cases of COVID-19 in nursing homes across Alberta as of Wednesday. In the two weeks since an outbreak was declared at Jennifer Patrick's nursing home, eight residents have died, and 19 residents and 10 staff members have contracted COVID-19.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/covid-19-dying-alone-1.5549739

Glen Cairn Community Resource Centre was kind enough to open their doors and we decided by working together we can service many more people in our community than working alone,"" Martino said.  Now, the two non-profit agencies have started a delivery service together, taking emergency aid packages of fresh produce and hygiene products to London families in the Hamilton Road and Pond Mills areas who wouldn't ordinarily have them.  Need for emergency food has quadrupled Crouch Neighbourhood Resource Centre executive director Jennifer Martino and Glen Cairn Community Resource Centre executive director Stanislav Rajic have teamed up to combine their resources and ease the strain of helping so many in need.  (Colin Butler/CBC News) The pity Martino feels however, comes from the fact that no matter no how much they've overcome and no matter how hard or well the two non-profits work together, the surge in demand during this unprecedented health crisis just seems to keep growing. In their first week, the two groups were delivering aid packages to 40 households, now it's 160 households or 400 people.  ""It's a pretty significant jump in a seven week time period. That's not the kind of jump in demand you want to see, of course,"" she said.  Charity groups like these are an important part of the city's social safety net, providing fresh food, resources and help to people who would otherwise fall through the cracks. The problem is the COVID-19 pandemic is straining their ability to help, forcing some non-profits to trim back their aid delivery when it's needed most. In this case however, the two groups have found that by pooling their resources, they can help even more people than they would going it alone.  Fresh food packages sent out by the local non-profits have a theme each week. (Colin Butler/CBC) ""It's been amazing to see people pivot and meet a need we didn't expect,"" she said. ""A lot of the people we're serving now are first-timers."" Martino said many of the people they're helping include families who have lost income because of the pandemic, seniors with health issues or the people with disabilities who are afraid or unable to leave their homes during the crisis. One story in particular stuck out for Martino about a man who lost his job during the pandemic and could no longer afford rent. He was forced to squeeze his wife, newborn baby and two teenagers into his mother's two-bedroom bungalow. She said the elderly mother was beside herself.  Packages include food, books, cleaning supplies One of the most sought-after items by families are cleaning products, which charities are including in their care packages.  (Colin Butler/CBC News) ""She was stressing not just about food supplies, but also things to keep these kids entertained,"" she said.  It's why the packages include not just food, but books, cleaning supplies, even hygiene products. Whatever a family may need, the two charities are willing to deliver.  ""Even something as simple as shampoo and conditioner. Those are the kinds of requests that are coming in on a weekly basis,"" she said.  It's a lot of work, but the reason the two non-profits are able to pull it off is because they have a large amount of volunteers, including the employees of London armsmaker General Dynamics Land Systems, who have offered help with sorting and delivery during the pandemic.  ""This week we had the most deliveries we've ever done, but we've also had the most volunteers. Going into week seven, we're feeling a lot better about it. The supports are starting to come through with the funding,"" Martino said. Hard to maintain robust food inventory Jennifer Martino is the executive director of Crouch Neighbourhood Resource Centre. Her Strawberry Shortcake mask was hand sewn by her mother.  (Colin Butler/CBC News) That includes a $20,000 donation announced by the United Way earlier this week to help bankroll the large amount of food they go through each week to keep families from going hungry.  ""It's hard to maintain the food levels we need,"" she said. ""Traditionally, non-profits rely on food donations and we work all year round and with the London food coalition. With less access to food, we've needed to purchase food in large volumes for the first time,"" she said.  ""It has been a leaning curve and, certainly, when you scale from 40 packages and a couple dozen people to these 400 people we're getting a week now, there's a lot of flexibility that is needed but we're finding we're having a bigger impact."" Martino said there is still more work that needs to be done. They're taking donations through an online campaign because no matter how many supplies they deliver, people always seem to need more. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-charity-1.5549514

""Overnight I saw comments from the Chinese foreign ministry talking about coercive activity with respect to Australia, who had the 'temerity' to ask for an investigation,"" said Pompeo. ""Who in the world wouldn't want an investigation of how this happened to the world?"" In an earlier interview Wednesday, Pompeo said the U.S. remains worried about laboratories in China and the world needs to get to the bottom of how the novel coronavirus began. ""I can tell you there were real concerns about the labs inside of China,"" Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) How one nursing home director's fast actions may have saved lives More than half the residents at one seniors home in the west end of Toronto have tested positive for COVID-19, along with 66 staff members, while 39 Eatonville residents have died of the virus. But at Ivan Franko Home, just seven kilometres down the road in Etobicoke, it has been a very different experience. So far, there have been no cases of the virus — and no deaths. The management team at the home implemented a comprehensive pandemic plan before the Ontario government declared a provincewide state of emergency. Since then, executive director Terry Tonkovich said, the home has required staff to only work at one facility — either Ivan Franko or another one, but not both. That measure was taken more than a month before Premier Doug Ford made it mandatory. Ivan Franko Home also hired an additional housekeeper to help with constant disinfecting of commonly touched surfaces. Management also provided two masks for each employee each day, while maintaining a strict control on its PPE inventory, and staff training and education on hygiene practices like hand sanitation and proper use of PPE were also increased. At Eatonville, however, the union representing employees said the home failed to keep staff and residents safe. Jane Meadus, a Toronto lawyer with the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly, said care homes were not doomed to experience a COVID-19 outbreak and some administrators could have done more to protect their residents and staff. ""I don't think it had to be this bad,"" Meadus said. Provincial data shows that at least 188 long-term care homes in Ontario have experienced a COVID-19 outbreak — a number Meadus considers ""much too high."" Every long-term care home must have an infection prevention and control program that includes guidelines for detecting infections and actions to prevent transmission, but the implementation of those protocols is up to each individual home, said Meadus. ""Long-term care homes here should have been put into a position where they were much better prepared and obviously that didn't happen,"" she said.

As of May 4, a variety of non-essential health-care and retail businesses will have the option of reopening under strict guidelines. Those services, businesses and venues include:  Non-urgent surgery and diagnostic procedures. Therapeutic and medical services. Retail businesses. Restaurants — patio/walk-up services. Hair salons. Museums, galleries and libraries. Seasonal day camps. Outdoor recreation and campgrounds.  All businesses and venues being allowed to reopen will be required to continue following physical distancing and stringent cleaning practices to protect both employees and customers, Pallister said. If results during or at the end of Phase 1 are not favourable, the province will not proceed with further phases and may instead reintroduce some measures, a news release from the government said. Read more about Manitoba's plan  Trudeau stresses workers' safety as Trump moves to keep meat-processing plants open Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wouldn't say whether his government would follow the lead of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and order meat-processing plants to stay open during the pandemic — but stressed that workers' safety is a priority. On Tuesday, in response to concerns about food shortages and supply chain disruptions, Trump issued an executive order under the Defence Production Act to compel meat-processing plants to continue operating. The world's biggest meat companies — including Smithfield Foods Inc., Cargill Inc., JBS USA and Tyson — have temporarily shuttered operations at about 20 slaughterhouses and processing plants in North America after workers fell ill with COVID-19. In Canada, the Cargill Inc. meat-processing plant near High River, Alta, is now the scene of the country's largest single site outbreak. The Cargill plant and the JBS plant in southern Alberta — where dozens more workers have tested positive — together supply about two-thirds of Canada's beef. McDonald's Canada, which prominently mentions its use of Canadian beef in its advertising, announced this morning that it will start importing meat as Canada's beef supply chain struggles to meet current demand. Read more about the situation at meat-processing plants  More than 50% of Canadian companies have lost at least one-fifth of their revenue to COVID-19, StatsCan says More than half of the companies in Canada have lost at least 20 per cent of their revenue because of the COVID-19 pandemic, new numbers from Statistics Canada and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce suggest. While the pandemic has hit all types of companies in all corners of Canada, the pain has not been felt evenly across the economy. Businesses in the accommodation and food services sector were most likely to have felt the pinch, followed by entertainment and recreation and retail trade. More than 60 per cent of businesses in those parts of the economy reported losing at least one-fifth of their usual revenue. On the other end of the spectrum, more than 40 per cent of businesses in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting and utilities sectors reported no change or an increase in revenue. The economic impact of COVID-19 was uneven geographically, too. More than half of all businesses in Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan reported losing at least one-fifth of their revenue. But almost one-third of companies in P.E.I, the territories and New Brunswick reported no change or an increase in revenue.

CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions about the COVID-19 pandemic, including this one from a teacher. If you have a question of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: So far, Quebec is the only province to say when children will return to the classroom. Elementary schools and daycares will gradually reopen beginning May 11 outside the Montreal region, and May 19 on the island of Montreal, in Laval and surrounding suburbs. But parents also have the option to keep their children at home. Ontario's schools will remain closed until at least May 31. Quebec is planning to physically distance children by limiting class sizes to 15 students and observing the two-metre distancing rule wherever possible, according to a report by CBC's Claire Loewen. Premier François Legault said that may mean moving some classes into vacant high schools for the time being to ensure there is enough space. Teachers will not wear protective clothing unless they have a health condition that puts them at risk. On school buses, the rule will be one child per bench seat and recess periods will be staggered to minimize the number of kids playing outside at one time. ""Kids are always touching things, themselves and each other and their faces. And you can't tell a child not to hug a friend or touch a toy,"" Dr. Dina Kulik, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and the founder of Kidcrew Pediatrics Medical Clinic, told CBC News. Kulik acknowledged many parents and children are struggling with school closures, but said that if we go back too soon, we may see a rise in cases because children can pass the virus along without showing any COVID-19 symptoms. AND FINALLY... On the road again, just can't wait to get on the road again  Matt Masters says he’s busier than ever with curbside concerts 3:06 A Calgary musician said his entire income stopped because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but now he's booked solid thanks to an innovative approach to taking the show on the road. ""I have sung on a ship in the middle of the South Pacific and from the back of a horse in front of thousands of people but I never thought I'd be singing on the rooftop of a minivan,"" Matt Masters told CBC News. With venues closed because of the pandemic, Masters decided to bring his music to people by performing curbside concerts — and he says he's tapped into something big. ""I have been booking music for 20 years. I have never had a week like this. I have booked 50 shows. I have another 50 emails I haven't even opened yet. I will be at my 100th gig in no time,"" said Masters, who hopes people find a fresh appreciation for artistic communities amid the pandemic.

Earlier this month, Moore began his fundraising mission for charities that help front-line National Health Service staff battling the COVID-19 crisis by completing laps of his garden with the help of a walking frame, initially setting out to raise just 1,000 pounds. As he celebrated his centenary, the amount he raised topped 30 million pounds ($52 million Cdn), the Guinness World Record for the most money raised by an individual through a walk. He has also become the oldest person to notch a number-one single on Britain's main music chart, having been featured on a cover version of You'll Never Walk Alone, with his endeavours winning the hearts and admiration of the public at home and across the world. To celebrate his birthday, Moore was appointed the first Honorary Colonel of the Army Foundation College, based near the town where he grew up, a position that came with the approval of Queen Elizabeth, the defence ministry said. He has also been re-presented with his Second World War Defence Medal, which he had lost.

""It's horrific,"" said Edward Lapointe, whose father-in-law lives at the home and had a mild case of the virus. ""These guys never had a chance."" Sixty-eight veteran residents who tested positive for the virus have died, officials said Tuesday, and it's not known whether another person who died had COVID-19. Another 82 residents and 81 employees have tested positive. The home's superintendent, who's been placed on administrative leave, has defended his response and accused state officials of falsely claiming they were unaware of the scope of the problem there. The superintendent, Bennett Walsh, said earlier this month state officials knew that the home was in ""crisis mode"" when it came to staffing shortages and were notified early and often about the contagion at the facility. An ambulance and a health-care worker with protective equipment arrive at the Soldiers' Home in Holyoke, Mass., on March 31.  (Hoang 'Leon' Nguyen/The Republican via AP) Staffing problems that plagued the home for years contributed to the virus spreading like wildfire, said Joan Miller, a nurse at the home. Because staffing was so tight, workers from one unit were constantly moving to other units to help out — and bringing their germs with them, she said. At one point, a unit was shut down because there wasn't enough staff to operate it, and those veterans were moved into close quarters in other parts of the building, she said. ""Veterans were on top of each other,"" she said. ""We didn't know who was positive and who was negative and then they grouped people together and that really exacerbated it even more,"" said Miller, who spoke through a mask during a break from her job at the facility. ""That's when it really blew up.""  Population at home more than halved The situation is now ""somewhat contained"" because there are so few veterans living there, Miller said. There were nearly 230 residents living at the home in late March and only about 100 remained on Monday, the Boston Globe reported. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Beth Lapointe said her father's roommate tested positive for the virus in March — and later died — but her father was initially denied a test because he didn't show any symptoms. As the virus spread, family members were kept in the dark about what was going on inside, she said. ""Every day I would ask different people, 'What's going on in there?' And I would never get information.""  U.S. vice-president tours Mayo Clinic without a mask, flouting medical centre's COVID-19 ruleSeveral U.S. long-term care facilities have had at least 40 coronavirus deaths Republican Gov. Charlie Baker's administration has hired an outside attorney to conduct an investigation into the deaths. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is also investigating to determine ""what went wrong at this facility and determine if legal action is warranted."" And the U.S. attorney's office in Massachusetts and Department of Justice's civil rights division are looking into whether the home violated residents' rights by failing to provide them proper medical care. The death toll at the home appears to be the largest at a long-term care facility in the United States, experts said. ""It's also symbolic of how unprepared many nursing facilities have been,"" said Dr. Michael Wasserman, president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine. ""Geriatricians and experts in long-term care medicine were sounding alarms at the beginning of March and we've essentially been ignored by everyone. Federal, state, local government and the nursing home industry,"" he said. No official count There is no official count of nursing home deaths across the country. The federal government has only recently required the country's more than 15,000 nursing homes to start reporting numbers of confirmed and presumed deaths and infections, but it is not yet clear when that count will be published. In the meantime, The Associated Press has been compiling its own tally from state health departments and media reports, finding at least 13,762 deaths from outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities across the country. But that is also likely an undercount because only about half the states are reporting nursing home deaths and not all count those who died without ever being tested for COVID-19. Can this pandemic force Canada to fix long-term care? Veterans homes in eastern Pennsylvania and southeastern Louisiana, among others, have seen significant death tolls in their facilities. In addition, those in Veterans Affairs hospitals have been susceptible to the coronavirus. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, there have been nearly 5,000 positive cases and 492 death in those facilities.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-veterans-home-1.5548812

Many of the administration's past pledges and goals on testing have not been met and Monday's developments were meant to fill critical gaps in White House plans to begin ""reopening"" the nation — ramping up testing while shifting the president's focus toward economic recovery. Private Republican Party polling shows Trump's path to a second term depends on the public's perception of how quickly the economy rebounds from the state-by-state shutdowns meant to slow the spread of the virus. Days after he set off a firestorm by publicly musing that scientists should explore the injection of toxic disinfectants as a potential virus cure, Trump said he found little use for his daily task force briefings, where he has time and again clashed with medical experts and reporters. Trump's aides had been trying to move the president onto more familiar and, they hope, safer, ground: Talking up the economy in more tightly controlled settings.

(Matthew Childs/Reuters) At one point the White House announced there would be no Trump briefing, but he appeared to have other ideas. Hours after the White House scrubbed the nightly briefing from its official schedule, it reversed course. Spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany said that briefings would be held later in the week but ""they might have a new look to them, a new focus to them."" ""We're entering a phase of looking to reopen the country and with that, the president will be focusing a lot on the economy,"" she said. Trump floats school reopenings On the conference call with governors, Trump suggested that many states should consider reopening schools before the end of the academic year, easing the way for parents to go back to work. ""Some of you might start thinking about school openings because a lot of people are wanting to have the school openings,"" Trump told the governors. The Associated Press obtained an audio recording of the call. A girl rides a scooter in Venice, Calif. on Sunday. Trump says states may considering reopening schools soon. (Apu Gomes/AFP via Getty Images) Among Monday's announcements is a new ""testing blueprint"" for states. It includes a focus on surveillance testing as well as ""rapid response"" programs to isolate those who test positive and identify those with whom they came in contact. The administration aims to have the market ""flooded"" with tests for the fall, when COVID-19 is expected to recur alongside the seasonal flu. At least 500,000 tests needed per day, Harvard says Jeremy Konyndyk, a disaster preparedness expert who helped lead the Obama administration response to Ebola, said the Trump administration's testing plans are well short of what is needed. Researchers at Harvard University have estimated the country needs to be testing a minimum of 500,000 people per day, and possibly many more. Konyndyk said we should be aiming to be doing two million to three million tests per day. ""Over the past month, we've doubled or if you want to be really generous tripled the testing capacity in this country. We need to take where we are now and expand it 10-fold,"" Konyndyk said. The White House argues that the limiting factor for the nation's COVID-19 testing is no longer the test kits or the chemicals and supplies needed to conduct the tests but rather the availability of resulting samples — either because guidelines on who could be tested are too stringent or because there are not enough health workers able to take nasal swabs. Trump's bump goes bust: Polls point to rising disapproval as voters sour on U.S. president's pandemic response The CDC also has been working on more detailed guidelines on reopening schools, restaurants and other establishments that could be released as soon as Monday. Draft guidelines sent by the CDC to Washington include a long list of recommendations for organizations as they begin to reopen, such as closing break rooms at offices, schools spacing desks about two metres apart and restaurants using disposable plates and menus. The draft guidance was obtained by The Associated Press from a federal official who was not authorized to release it. Some states have started to ease closure orders, and Trump is expected to spend the coming days highlighting his administration's efforts to help businesses and employees. Aides said the president would hold more frequent roundtables with CEOs, business owners and beneficiaries of the trillions of dollars in federal aid already approved by Congress, and begin to outline what he hopes to see in a future recovery package. Worries among Republicans Trump last left the White House complex a month ago, and plans are being drawn up for a limited schedule of travel within the next few weeks, aides said. It would be a symbolic show that the nation is beginning to reopen. The shift comes in conjunction with what the White House sees as encouraging signs across the country, with the pace of new infections stabilizing and deaths declining. WATCH | Media expert says Trump's COVID-19 briefings have no news value: Frank Sesno, director of George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs, criticizes the media for reporting on U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments at the COVID-19 briefings, which he deems to have no news value.   7:52 Still, medical experts warn that the virus will continue to haunt the country at least until a vaccine is developed. And they say the risk of a severe second wave is high if physical distancing measures are relaxed too quickly or if testing and contact tracing schemes aren't developed before people return to normal behaviours. Worries are growing among Republicans and Trump allies over the president's increasingly erratic handling of the coronavirus crisis. For weeks, Republicans have grown concerned that Trump's daily briefings were doing him grievous political damage. Though Trump cherished the TV ratings, the modest polling bump he received in the early days of the pandemic has vanished amid a flurry of misstatements and partisan fights.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/trump-economy-coronavirus-1.5546723

A statue of a doorman outside a Vancouver apartment building is seen wearing a mask. (Maggie MacPherson/CBC) A look inside the COVID-19 unit at B.C.'s biggest hospital Vancouver General Hospital, the biggest hospital in B.C., is one of 17 around the province that has morphed into a primary site specializing in treating coronavirus patients. CBC News got an exclusive look inside the hospital's specialized COVID-19 unit. VGH's COVID-19 critical care unit is divided in two: the warm zone and the hot zone. The hot zone is where the infected patients are examined and treated. The warm zone is a buffer area that acts as a staging zone for health-care workers. Each team spends up to three hours making the rounds inside the hot zone before peeling off their personal protective equipment, washing their hands like lives depend on it and then rotating and swapping out. ""When the nurses come out of the hot zone, they're usually drenched in sweat, and you can see their mask that's outlined on their face,"" Dr. Donald Griesdale said. ""Then in the warm zone, if issues come up … we have a really good two-way system so we're easily able to communicate with the staff inside the hot zone."" The warm zone is also where all of the experts involved — from physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists to dietitians and pharmacists — convene and communicate. As a team, they discuss all the issues for each patient and come up with individual care plans for the day. Nurses are the main point of human contact for patients. And there's an underlying uncertainty on both sides that's hard to describe. Mostly, it's fear of the unknown. ""[Patients are] scared when they come in, they're scared of getting a breathing tube put in, they're scared of what's going to happen. And we're scared for them, to be honest,"" said Jess Donald, a registered nurse who's worked in the emergency room at VGH since 2007. The biggest challenge, she said, is finding ways to have personal interaction. Despite technology's best attempts, the feeling of isolation never really goes away. But if you ask the doctors and nurses about the pressure of serving on the front lines against this virus, they say it's not about them, writes CBC's Tanya Fletcher. It's about everyone: a caring community that's become an unexpected inspiration, and the support of a province is the most pleasant surprise of all. Click below to watch more from The National Part 1 of 3 of Rosemary Barton’s exclusive interview with Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam about Canada’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 9:44 IN BRIEF PM says COVID-19 measures are working, but Canada is 'not out of the woods yet' Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said today that new modelling shows public health measures are working to slow the spread of COVID-19 — but cautioned that easing restrictions too fast could wipe out the progress made to date. ""We are in the middle of the most serious public health emergency Canada has ever seen, and if we lift measures too quickly, we could lose the progress we've made,"" Trudeau said. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, cited some positive pandemic news in the new modelling data. Caseload growth is slowing across the country and Canada has experienced slower growth than many other countries, she said. New modelling shows that while the number of new cases was doubling every three days previously, it is now doubling every 16 days. Tam said the revised projections reflect the ""heavy toll"" the virus is taking on vulnerable populations. For the virus to die out, the average number of people to whom an infected individual passes the virus has to drop below one. Tam said that right now, strong controls such as physical distancing and self-isolation have limited the average number of people each case infects to slightly more than one. Tam warned that public health measures will need to remain in place until there is a high level of immunity or a vaccine to avoid ""future epidemic waves."" Read more about the latest federal modelling  Doctors want Ottawa to keep them in the loop on PPE shortages, CMA survey says Canada's medical doctors are calling on the federal government to be more open and transparent about the supply of personal protective equipment, saying pervasive anxiety on the front lines of the pandemic fight could be eased by more information. The Canadian Medical Association recently conducted a survey of its physician members and found the overwhelming majority of the nearly 2,500 doctors who responded are feeling stressed about the pandemic and its impact on their families and patients. CMA president Dr. Sandy Buchman said more than a quarter of the doctors who participated in the survey said the problem of shortages of PPE has improved in the last three weeks — while another 25 per cent-plus said the situation has become worse. Roughly four in 10 of those surveyed saw little change either way. Acknowledging the government is going ""full out"" to procure protective gear, Buchman said little information about the status of supplies is trickling down to the front lines. ""We're not hearing what's coming down the pipeline in a clear and co-ordinated way,"" Buchman told CBC. ""Where is it? When do you anticipate it is coming to us, to our region, to our hospital?""

CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions about the COVID-19 pandemic, including this one from an audience member whose surgery in Toronto was cancelled in mid-March. If you have a question of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott said Monday that the province is planning to bring back surgeries, prioritizing cancer operations, as part of its roadmap to reopen, but she would not specify when. Officials acknowledge they need to see a consistent reduction in new COVID-19 cases before easing restrictions. In the dramatically scaled-back operating room activity amid the pandemic, hospitals across Canada are continuing to perform surgeries on patients who are at high risk of death or disability if they aren't treated within days or weeks — a category that includes the most urgent cancer and cardiovascular cases. You can read more about the backlog of surgeries created by the cancellations during the pandemic here. Read more answers to COVID-19 questions  THE SCIENCE How COVID-19 symptoms develop, and how long they last  Here's a closer look at what has been learned about how COVID-19 symptoms develop from international studies and interviews with front-line doctors. An important note: the averages represent typical cases, and there tends to be a wide range at all stages of the disease. The period in which a person is infected but shows no symptoms appears to average around five to six days, although it can vary from one to 14 days, according to the World Health Organization and Chinese data. Because people without symptoms aren't usually tested, positive tests typically represent infections that happened on average five days and up to two weeks earlier. Studies also suggest people with no symptoms or mild symptoms are responsible for most of the spread. Even those who go on to experience more severe symptoms typically begin with mild symptoms, most often fever and a dry cough, although they can also include more unusual symptoms such as loss of taste and smell. Symptoms will remain mild in about 80 per cent of cases, the WHO says, until recovery in about 14 days. Typically, the cough lasts a week longer than the fever, a Chinese study found. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms are told to recover at home. A key, more severe symptom that sometimes leads to hospitalization is shortness of breath or dyspnea, which shows up on average five to six days after symptoms began, Chinese researchers reported in medical journals JAMA and The Lancet. Studies in China and the U.S suggest that most patients who are hospitalized are admitted, on average, about a week after symptoms begin. In Canada, patients appear to be sickest at about that time, said Dr. Bram Rochwerg, site lead at the Juravinski Hospital intensive care unit in Hamilton and an associate professor at McMaster University.

How a puzzle library in Sackville, N.B., became an appreciated distraction amid the pandemic Angela Swanson opened a puzzle library out of her carport to share her love of puzzles and to give people in Sackville, N.B., something to do during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tori Weldon/CBC) Angela Swanson had planned to start a puzzle library out of her Sackville, N.B., home in the fall — but when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, she decided now was the time. She canvassed friends and cleaned out her own collection to stock the shelves in her carport with jigsaw puzzles in a variety of colours and sizes. Swanson spread the word through social media, and before long neighbours and strangers were dropping by to pick out their next pandemic puzzle.

Email: Covid@cbc.ca  A day after outlining a plan to allow children to return to daycares and primary schools in May, Quebec Premier François Legault laid out his plans Tuesday to begin reopening some businesses in the province. Over the course of the month of May, three sectors will be allowed some degree of reopening. They are:  Retail stores not in shopping malls. Retail stores that are in malls but have a direct door to the outside. Construction and civil engineering. Manufacturing.  Stores outside of the Montreal region will be permitted to reopen May 4, while those in the Montreal area will reopen May 11. Construction projects, including road work, will fully resume May 11, with about 85,000 workers expected to be back to work. Manufacturing companies will be allowed to reopen May 4 with some restrictions: those that have 50 or fewer workers will be allowed to reopen with full staff; those with more than 50 employees will only be allowed to have 50 workers plus 50 per cent of the total number of employees above that for any shift throughout the day. Construction projects in Quebec will be able to resume in May under the province's plan to reopen parts of the province's economy. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) Legault said the idea is to reopen gradually and follow up to ensure there is no negative impact on infection rates or on hospitals. And he said people will have to continue to follow physical distancing measures. ""Continue to act as if everybody you meet has the virus."" WATCH | Legault says the plan is to restart the economy without restarting the pandemic:  Quebec Premier François Legault outlined his government's plan to reopen the Quebec economy and says physical distancing will continue to be necessary. 1:24 Legault on Monday announced a plan that would allow children in daycare ​​​​and primary school in most parts of Quebec to head back to class on May 11 — though attendance won't be mandatory. Daycares and primary schools in the Montreal area would open on May 19. High schools, CEGEPs and universities will reopen in the fall, Legault said, noting that officials felt primary-aged schoolchildren would benefit the most from additional weeks of class time. ""We will analyze the situation every day and adjust if necessary,"" he said. ""The watchword here is prudence.""  With school plan unveiled, Quebec to announce economy relaunch Quebec's move to reopen schools sows confusion, fear among parents  The province's top doctor was quick to note that the easing of some restrictions did not mean that people should stop following public health measures and move around widely.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday said that the federal government would soon be releasing shared guidelines on how to handle reopening. ""We need common guidelines to make sure that the decisions being taken across the country are grounded in a shared understanding and appreciation of what science and experts are telling us.""  The shared principles, which Trudeau said have been agreed to by the federal, provincial and territorial governments, won't provide specific dates or measures. Instead, they will serve as a framework around what needs to happen before the economy is gradually restarted. Federal health officials update projections Trudeau spoke ahead of a Tuesday afternoon briefing from federal health officials, who delivered revised modelling and forecasts for COVID-19 in Canada. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said that ongoing public health measures, including physical distancing, are critical to staying at the lower end of projections. ""We are making clear progress to slow the spread and bring the epidemic under control thanks to the commitment of Canadians who are following public health advice to protect themselves and others,"" she said.  PM says COVID-19 measures are working but Canada is 'not out of the woods yet' Get the details of the federal COVID-19 modelling update   The new modelling shows that while the number of new cases was doubling every three days previously, it is now doubling every 16 days. Short-term projections predict between 53,191 and 66,835 cases by May 5, and between 3,277 and 3,883 deaths by that date. Tam said the way the epidemic is unfolding varies across the country, ""so when and how control measures are readjusted and are relaxed will need to be decided based on the local epidemiological situation."" WATCH | Dr. Tam explains what goes into decisions about reopening schools and businesses: Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, talks about jurisdictions choosing to loosen public health measures to reopen certain facilities, including schools. 2:36 She said the new projections reflect the ""heavy toll"" COVID-19 is taking on vulnerable populations, including the elderly in long-term care homes and the homeless, and that relaxing controls too quickly will ""squander"" the efforts to date and put the population at risk of another wave of infection. ""We are actually going to be living with COVID-19 for the near future — and monitoring very carefully, so if there's any upswing … any cases and contacts have to be identified and managed so you don't get that upswing again."" The problem areas continue to be long term care centres which make up 79% of deaths countrywide. Congregate living situations are also problematic. <a href=""https://t.co/1EHv0ARbw0"">pic.twitter.com/1EHv0ARbw0</a>&mdash;@RosieBarton When asked whether he would send his own kids back to school if he were in Quebec, Trudeau said he would evaluate the situation at the time when schools actually open their doors. ""We know every single week we see changes in how we're doing, on where there are outbreaks, on equipment and supports available,"" he said, noting that he'd want to know what the school itself was planning to do to maintain physical distancing and create safe working conditions. WATCH | Trudeau talks about Quebec's plan to reopen some schools: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with reporters on Tuesday. 1:54 Neighbouring New Brunswick, which has had far fewer cases than Quebec, has already loosened some restrictions, including opening some outdoor spaces and allowing people to form ""bubbles"" of two families. Prince Edward Island released its plan Tuesday to ease restrictions. Priority non-urgent health-care services are to begin May 1, including elective surgeries, physiotherapy, optometry and chiropractic treatment. Outdoor gatherings of limited size and activities such as fishing and golf will also be allowed. Saskatchewan has also previously released a five-phase reopening plan, with expected dates attached to the first two phases. Ontario plan focuses on how not when Ontario, which unveiled its plan on Monday, didn't attach any dates to its framework. Premier Doug Ford said the framework is about how the province will reopen — not when. ""We're all missing birthdays, religious celebrations and once-in-a-lifetime milestones. These are all too real, a painful loss of memories, and moments taken away by this deadly virus,"" Ford said. ""But that is why we must continue.""  A slow, methodical and gradual reopening will help the province avoid another period of shutdown, Ford said. WATCH | Ontario reveals reopening plan, no timeline: Ontario Premier Doug Ford revealed details of how the province would reduce COVID-19 restrictions and reopen businesses, but without giving any specific timeline. 1:54 Ford said he wants to see the economy ""get going"" but can't risk an escalation in cases if the province opens prematurely. As of 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Canada had 50,026 confirmed and presumptive cases of the novel coronavirus. Provinces and territories listed 19,244 cases as recovered or resolved. A CBC tally of COVID-19-related deaths, which is based on provincial health data, local public health information and CBC reporting, listed 2,958 deaths in Canada and two abroad. A case tracking site maintained by U.S.-based Johns Hopkins University reported more than three million cases around the world, with over 212,000 reported coronavirus-related deaths.  Should masks be mandatory in public to stop the spread of COVID-19? How hospitals will tackle the backlog of nearly 100,000 delayed surgeries  There is no proven treatment or vaccine for the novel virus, which first emerged in China in late 2019. While most cases are moderate or mild, some people — especially the elderly and people with underlying health issues — are at greater risk of severe disease or death. Public health officials in Canada and around the world have cautioned that reported numbers don't show the full picture, as they don't reflect people that haven't been tested or cases that are still under investigation. Read on for a look at what's happening in Canada, the U.S. and around the world. What's happening in the provinces and territories In British Columbia, a COVID-19 outbreak in a poultry processing plant in Coquitlam is responsible for the majority of new cases reported by the province. Health Minister Adrian Dix says 39 of the 55 positive tests reported Tuesday are connected to the spread of the virus at Superior Poultry Processors Ltd. Read more about what's happening in B.C., including a story about how Haida Gwaii communities are ramping up enforcement of a ban on visitors.

Trump, seated next to DeSantis in the Oval Office, insisted that the United States was doing enough testing to protect Americans reentering the workforce and said he would sign an executive order to address ""liability problems"" in the nation's food supply chain. He said the administration was talking to airlines about requiring temperature and virus checks for some travellers as they board flights. Trump has claimed for weeks now that airlines have been screening passengers, even though they're not. And he said the idea of having passengers wear masks sounded ""like a good idea."" U.S. President Donald Trump listens as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis talks about the coronavirus response during a meeting Tuesday in the Oval Office. (Evan Vucci/The Associated Press) The administration had been sharply criticized for not overseeing widespread testing, but Trump said no amount would ever be good enough for critics in the media. Florida, with a high population of older Americans vulnerable to the disease, has long been a source of concern, and DeSantis was slower to impose social distancing guidelines than other governors were. But DeSantis, a fellow Republican and close Trump ally, promoted his state's ability to test its citizens. According to the Johns Hopkins database, the U.S. surpassed one million cases Tuesday, with more than 57,000 deaths.  What's happening around the world From The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 4 p.m. ET Italy's Premier Giuseppe Conte says the risk of a second wave of COVID-19 ""is concrete,"" as the country moves into a new phase of living ""alongside"" the coronavirus with the loosening of some lockdown measures starting next Monday. Conte has been visiting some of the hardest-hit communities in the northern region of Lombardy in a sign of institutional support for the sacrifices of medical personnel and solidarity with citizens in their eighth week of total lockdown.

Now, they find themselves adjusting to the idea of sending their children back to school in May. The province's decision to open elementary schools and daycares next month has left parents filled with questions, and divided on whether to send their kids back. Starting May 11, parents living outside of the greater Montreal area will be able to send their children back to elementary school and daycare. Elementary schools and daycares in the Montreal area are set to open the following week. All other schools — high schools, colleges and universities — won't physically reopen until late August. Patricia Clermont, who lives in Montreal's Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district, said her children, ages seven and 11, are eager to return to class. But she's nervous about the province's plan and hasn't made a decision yet. ""If we don't succeed with this reopening, it would mean we have done this confinement for nothing, and it would be a major feeling of failing,"" said Clermont. Playgrounds have been quiet since last month, when Quebec put in place restrictions to limit the spread of COVID-19. (Ivanoh Demers/CBC) Shelley Reuter is more definitive. She won't be sending her son, who is in Grade 4, back to school until September. She said the government's reopening plan is not well-thought-out, and is especially unfair to teachers. ""Laying this pretty heavy responsibility of making sure the students are physically distancing, that they're washing their hands all the time, I think that's already too much on top of what teachers are already doing,"" Reuter said. Jennifer Bento, a Grade 3 teacher in LaSalle and a parent herself, echoed that perspective. ""I feel like there's more questions than answers. I was hoping for more clarity about protocols and expectations for how we were supposed to be doing social distancing with younger children."" VideoYour questions answered about going back to school in QuebecMay opening of elementary schools, daycares 'a necessary decision,' says Quebec education minister Education Minister Jean-François Roberge said Monday classes will be limited to a maximum of 15 students, and the two-metre distancing rule will have to be respected wherever possible. That may mean moving some classes into vacant high schools for the time being to ensure there is enough space. Students who have health conditions that could put them at a higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19 are not to return to school, Roberge said.  The minister is also recommending that teachers over the age of 60 remain at home, saying they will be able to work remotely. Too soon? Quebec has moved more quickly than other provinces to reopen schools, despite having the most deaths related to COVID-19.  Ontario, for instance, announced Sunday that public schools will remain closed in the province through May 31. While some parents feel Quebec is getting ahead of itself, the idea of holding off until the fall also has drawbacks. Patricia Roque, who is trying to complete her PhD, said keeping her two-year-old daughter at home has been a grind, despite some special moments. ""There will not be a vaccine in the next year, year and a half,"" she said. ""So what are we waiting for?"" Patricia Roque says she will send her two-year-old back to daycare. (Alison Northcott/CBC) Montrealer Jen Grier said she will send her 12-year-old son back to school. ""With the directives of not having full classes, I think it's allowing the ministry and each individual school to sit down and figure out how this is going to work for now and for September. The timing makes sense,"" Grier said. 'The overwhelming reaction was fear,' parent says Outside the Montreal area, the prospect of sending their children back to school in two weeks took many by surprise.

Under Kim Jong-un, North Korea has expanded its arsenal of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, and with no obvious successor, any change in leadership in the authoritarian country would raise concerns about instability that could impact other North Asian countries and the United States. The speculation about Kim's health erupted after his unprecedented absence from ceremonies marking the April 15 birth anniversary of his grandfather and founder of the country, Kim Il-sung. South Korea's Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees engagement with the North, said it was plausible that Kim decided against attending because of the coronavirus, given the stringent steps his government has taken to head off an outbreak. ""It is true that he had never missed the anniversary for Kim II-sung's birthday since he took power, but many anniversary events including celebrations and a banquet had been cancelled because of coronavirus concerns,"" the unification minister told a parliamentary hearing. South Korean Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, seen here in this March 2019 photograph, said today there were at least two instances since mid-January when North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had been unsighted for nearly 20 days.  (Kim Hong-Ji) ""I don't think that's particularly unusual given the current [coronavirus] situation,"" the minister said, though North Korea has said it has no confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Reports of sending letters The South Korean minister noted that there were at least two instances since mid-January when Kim Jong-un had been unsighted for nearly 20 days. The last time official media in the secretive North Korean state reported on Kim's whereabouts was when he presided over a meeting on April 11, but there have been near-daily reports of him sending letters and diplomatic messages. South Korean officials emphasize they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea and have cautioned against reports that Kim may be ill. The unification minister described reports that Kim had undergone a heart procedure, and that a Chinese medical team had traveled to North Korea, as ""fake news."" Citing three people familiar with the situation, Reuters reported on Saturday that China had dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on Kim Jong-un, though it was unclear what the trip signalled in terms of Kim's health. China sends team to advise North Korea on Kim Jong-un's health amid conflicting reports A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Washington's view was largely in line with the South Korean minister's assessment. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he has a good idea of how Kim Jong-un is doing and hopes he is fine, but would not elaborate. On Tuesday, Trump was asked by a reporter about these comments and whether he thought Kim was still in control of North Korea and replied: ""I don't want to comment on it. I just wish him well."" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he was aware of reports on Kim's health and he was paying close attention to developments. Large events cancelled North Korea had cancelled some large events and imposed a border lockdown and quarantine measures in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus. But if Kim Jong-un is hiding out because of fears surrounding COVID-19, it would ""puncture a hole in the state media narrative of how this crisis has been perfectly managed,"" said Chad O'Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea. ""If he is merely trying to avoid infection, it should theoretically be very easy to release photos or videos of a healthy-looking Kim,"" he said. What we know about Kim Jong-un's health An authoritative source familiar with U.S. intelligence reporting said on Monday it was entirely possible Kim had disappeared from public view to avoid exposure to COVID-19 and the sighting of his presidential train in the coastal resort area of Wonsan did suggest he may be there or have been there recently. But the source said that since there was no authoritative backing for such a conclusion, U.S. agencies were also still considering the possibility Kim might be ill, even seriously. 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, said on Saturday that satellite images from last week showed a special train that was probably Kim's at Wonsan, lending weight to reports he had been spending time in the resort area. On Tuesday, the website NK News said leisure boats often used by Kim off the coast of Wonsan had been active throughout this month, indicating his likely continued presence in the area.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-kim-jong-un-south-korea-1.5547438

""You won't see me cry all the tears in my body because I have already shed them for my patients who died. The same patients I've known for two years, whom I have cared for and, until now, whom I have ensured a quality of life."" There are 70 cases of COVID-19 in the home, representing 85 per cent of the residents. To date, 20 people have died, according to the latest figures from the CISSS de Laval, the regional health authority that oversees the home. In an interview, Gilbert described conditions inside the CHSLD as almost ""war-like."" She said there's a shortage of staff and a shortage of medical equipment. The result, she said, is that staff are not able to give adequate care. In a statement, the CISSS de Laval did not deny the conditions were poor, saying it understands there are challenges in long-term care homes. ""The impact on employees should not be minimized,"" wrote spokesman Pierre-Yves Séguin, adding that workers have access to an employee assistance program and are encouraged to use it. Séguin said more than 150 people have been hired over the last two weeks and clinical staff from other departments are being redeployed to long-term care homes.

The province will reopen its economy through a three-stage process in the coming weeks and months, but the government document offers no firm date and few details about when that effort will begin. ""The framework is about how we're reopening, not when we're reopening,"" Premier Doug Ford said at a news conference. While Ontario is believed to be at its peak in terms of the outbreak, how long that peak lasts remains a question, he said. Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer health, said last week that the province would need to see fewer than 200 new cases daily for an extended stretch before relaxing COVID-19 emergency measures would be feasible. With the province still falling somewhat short of its goal of processing 13,000 tests per day, whether the number of new cases being reported daily reflects the true number of new infections remains a question. Read more about Ontario's plan  Minister says COVID-19 is empowering domestic violence abusers as rates rise in parts of Canada Canada's minister for women and gender equality said the COVID-19 crisis has empowered perpetrators of domestic violence as consultations reveal that abuse rates are rising in parts of the country. Climbing rates of domestic violence have been reported around the world amid orders to stay indoors and limit social interaction. Closures of some shelters and reduced capacity at others is worsening the problem, with the United Nations calling for immediate global action to halt the surge. After the pandemic's onset, Maryam Monsef said her department consulted with front-line organizations, provinces and territories and MPs from across Canada to better understand the impact of the crisis. The discussions uncovered a 20 to 30 per cent increase in rates of gender-based violence and domestic violence in some regions of the country, although data on where the uptick is occurring is not yet available. So far, the federal government has pledged $50 million to assist women's shelters, sexual assault centres and similar facilities in Indigenous communities throughout the crisis. But not everyone is aware that shelters — which have been deemed an essential service — are still an available option, said Wanda McGinnis, CEO of the Wheatland Crisis Society in rural Alberta. ""A pandemic doesn't make [violence] stop,"" she said. ""A pandemic just makes that silent.""

The subsidy is available for three months, retroactive to March 15, and provides up to $847 a week per employee. But Trudeau warned that Canadians can receive the wage subsidy or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) — not both. Some business groups say many firms don't qualify for the subsidy because of the rule on revenue loss. Others have had to close down already. Meanwhile, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) said many still aren't clear on how the program works and who is eligible. ""Unfortunately, the subsidy has already come too late for some businesses, who are not currently in a position to rehire laid-off staff,"" CFIB president Dan Kelly said in a statement.

""It depends on your age,"" said Kulik, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and the founder of Kidcrew Medical, a pediatric clinic in Toronto. ""If you are old enough to take care of yourself, cook your own meals and don't need your parents to care for you day-to-day, I would suggest isolating from them."" However, every family should have a plan, and if the parents and child feel as though the child would be better off living with a friend or relative, then that's an option, too. But Kulik cautions that it's possible the child could be asymptomatic, meaning a person has the virus but is not showing any symptoms, and that could put the other caregivers at risk. If you are sharing a space with someone who's sick, Kulik also recommends wiping down all high-traffic surfaces such as counters, door handles and even the refrigerator with products approved for use against the coronavirus, including: alcohol, peroxide or a bleach solution. She also advises using a different washroom if possible, which should help contain the spread. If you are a youth who needs support during the COVID-19 pandemic, contact Kids Help Phone.

Meanwhile, the number of known infections in the United States kept climbing on Monday, topping 980,000 as the number of lives lost to COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, surpassed 55,600. U.S. small business aid process reopens after 1st round saw big, publicly listed companies benefit Officials in some of the hardest-hit states such as New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts have been emphasizing for weeks that more testing and contact tracing for the virus needed to be in place before they could implement road maps for restarting their economies. Contact tracing involves tracking down and testing people who may have been around anyone already infected.

Congress passes relief bill, McConnell suggests some states may be better off declaring bankruptcy Meanwhile, President Donald Trump on Monday slammed U.S. cities and states seeking billions more dollars in federal aid to offset huge losses from the coronavirus outbreak as members of Congress spar over the next round of potential economic relief. Democrats want more aid to help cities and states left out of the nearly $3 trillion US in economic relief already enacted during the crisis.

Filipino workers at meatpacking plant feel unfairly blamed for Canada's biggest COVID-19 outbreak  McConnell attempted to clarify that statement in a radio interview on Monday, saying he was simply ""pointing out [states] have their own fiscal problems that predate the coronavirus."" He also said there will most likely be another state and local funding bill, ""but we need to make sure that we achieve something that will go beyond simply sending out money."" Congress has allocated $150 billion for state and local governments, but governors requested another $500 billion and cities and counties want $250 billion to cover the costs of responding to the outbreak and replace lost revenue. Executive says food supply chain is 'vulnerable' South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem on Monday said she hoped Smithfield's Sioux Falls pork processing plant can reopen soon, a day after U.S. labour regulators urged the meat industry to adopt certain measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus among workers. ""They have some mitigation measures to put in place, but I think in a matter of days it could be opened, as long as everybody continues to work together and get it done,"" Noem told Fox News in an interview. Smithfield Foods, the world's biggest pork processor, has shut down several U.S. plants due to a rash of coronavirus cases among employees, raising concerns about the nation's meat supply and worker safety. Its cases in Sioux Falls triggered a so-called hot spot of U.S. coronavirus cases. Noem, a Republican, was among the small number of governors who did not issue stay-at-home orders.

New York cancels presidential primary New York state on Monday cancelled its presidential primary over concerns voting was an unnecessary risk amid the COVID-19 pandemic, drawing an angry response from the campaign of Bernie Sanders, who has suspended his White House bid but hoped to remain on the ballot. With former vice-president Joe Biden the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, Douglas Kellner, one of two of the party's commissioners on the New York State Board of Elections, said it would be ""unnecessary and frivolous"" to hold an effectively uncompetitive election in a state that is the epicentre of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak.

President Cyril Ramaphosa has been praised for decisive action to curb the epidemic in Africa's most industrialized country, which has one of the continent's strictest lockdowns and has recorded just 4,546 cases and 87 deaths. ""South Africans have come together like never before to wage the struggle against this virus,"" Ramaphosa told the country. However, recriminations are rising over inequalities in conditions to cope with the restrictions and distribution of aid around an economy already in recession. ""Our government loves … to keep white people happy and safe, even at the expense of Africans,"" Julius Malema, leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party, said in a statement. Twenty-six years ago, South Africans rejoiced at their first ever fully inclusive democratic election, which saw Nelson Mandela elected as their first president under black majority rule, ending decades of apartheid. Freedom Day has since been designated a public holiday on April 27. But critics say Mandela's legacy party, the African National Congress, has not done enough to redress inequalities in land, wealth and access to services that are apartheid's most enduring legacy, and which on some measures have worsened.

In Quebec, Premier François Legault said for the good of children, especially those with learning difficulties, the province is moving forward with a plan to begin reopening schools.  In his daily briefing Monday, the premier said five or six months without attending school could pose serious, long-term risks for many children. ""Life must go on,"" he said. A closed schoolyard is seen through its fence in Montreal on Monday. (Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press) Elementary schools and daycares will begin reopening on May 11 outside of Montreal and on May 19 on the island of Montreal. All other schools — high schools, colleges and universities — won't reopen until late August. But Legault said that timeline will depend on the number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 remaining stable. There are now 1,541 people in hospital — an increase of 23 over Sunday. Some 210 patients are in intensive care, down five from yesterday.  WATCH | Legault details plans to reopen schools: Premier François Legault says elementary schools and childcare centres outside Montreal are expected to open May 11, though attendance will not be mandatory. High schools, CEGEPs and universities will remain closed. 1:06 Eighty-four more deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours. Of those, 79 were residents of long-term-care homes, or CHSLDs.

(Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) In Ontario, the government announced it will reopen the province's economy through a three-stage process in the coming weeks and months, though it offered no firm date and few details about when that effort will begin.  Health and safety ""will continue to be a top priority as Ontario transitions to a 'new normal,'"" a government document unveiled Monday afternoon said. A Framework for Reopening our Province emphasizes that public health officials will have input during each phase of the process. According to the province, the stages are as follows:  Stage 1: Open select workplaces and allow some small gatherings. Stage 2: Open more workplaces and outdoor spaces and allow some larger gatherings. Stage 3: Further relax restrictions on public gatherings and open all workplaces ""responsibly.""  WATCH | Ford moves cautiously to reopen economy: Doug Ford says the province has 'flattened the curve' against COVID-19 but warns the timing to allow businesses to reopen still depends on some strict criteria. 0:57 Each stage will last at least two to four weeks, at which point Ontario's chief medical officer of health will be able to tighten certain restrictions, extend the stage or advise that the province can move into the next phase. While there are no specific dates included in the planning document, when and how Ontario begins reopening will depend on a number of factors, including:  A consistent two-to-four week drop in new daily COVID-19 cases. A decrease in cases that can't be traced to a source. A decrease in new hospitalizations.  Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said last week that the province would need to see fewer than 200 new cases daily for an extended stretch before relaxing COVID-19 emergency measures. With the province still falling somewhat short of its goal of processing 13,000 tests per day, whether the number of new cases being reported daily reflects the true number of new infections remains a question.

She also said the closure of the Canada/U.S. border did not happen sooner because it wasn't part of the government's pandemic preparedness plan. ""Could we have done more at the time? You can retrospectively say yes, absolutely, you could screen more, or you could change your stance. But at the time we had very, very few cases globally and in Canada,"" Tam said. Wage subsidy program opens Monday also marks the first day that eligible businesses can apply for Ottawa's $73-billion wage subsidy program. The federal government initially proposed a 10 per cent wage subsidy for eligible workers, but after criticism from businesses and the opposition, the government boosted the subsidy to 75 per cent of wages, offering up to $847 a week. Businesses that can are being urged to top workers up and cover the remaining 25 per cent. The first payments should begin to arrive as soon as May 7, Trudeau said at his daily briefing on Monday.

However, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who talked to the premiers on Friday about their recovery strategies, stressed yesterday that none of them hinge on people being immune to catching COVID-19 twice. He said it is too soon to talk about so called ""immunity passports"" for Canadians who've been infected with COVID-19 because the science is still unclear about whether those who have recovered from the virus are protected from catching it again.

Backlogs have cleared, but testing is mostly still targeted — instead of the wider, ramped-up testing that infectious disease physicians are calling for to control the spread.  Here's a primer on different types of testing, and their pros and cons:  Swabs  Nose or throat swabs test for the presence of genetic material from the coronavirus. They aid in diagnosis and are also important for the detective work of tracing contacts — those who may have been exposed to an infected person, such as family members, health-care workers or nearby travellers The swabs are typically inserted into a patient's nose and then sealed into a tube with growth medium to support the virus until it can get to the lab.  WATCH | What it's like to have a nasal swab: A look at what patients could expect if they end up in an emergency room with COVID-19 symptoms. 1:59 The sample needs to be collected carefully from the correct area. It's estimated that errors can occur about eight to 10 per cent of the time, which contributes to false negatives. Labs also need specialized equipment and skilled staff. Provincial lab officials say the amount of virus in the upper respiratory tract seems to peak in the first week of symptoms and could fall too low to be detected later. Despite the drawbacks, swabs are the gold standard for detecting a coronavirus infection. Why isn't Canada testing everyone for coronavirus?THE DOSEIf I test negative for COVID-19, am I clear? Health Canada says only diagnostic tests that it authorizes can be imported or sold in this country, based on a review of evidence indicating they will provide accurate and reliable results.  There are no legitimate ""home test kits"" available in Canada. Office-based tests ""Point-of-care"" diagnostic tests use a blood prick sample, rather than a nasal swab. They can be done while a patient waits at a doctor's office, clinic or hospital, with results in under an hour.  But doctors and scientists still need to determine their accuracy in the real world, as opposed to under the ideal conditions of the testmaker's lab.  Diagnostic tests don't provide information about if someone's been previously exposed to the virus or has successfully mounted an immune response. Blood tests for antibodies That's where antibody or serology tests could come in. Instead of searching for the virus itself, these search for proteins in the blood called antibodies. Your body produces antibodies weeks after successfully fighting off an infection. In Canada, antibody tests for COVID-19 are just a research tool and aren't available to the public.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said it's a ""reasonable assumption"" that, if you have antibodies, you will be protected from another infection. But scientists still need to test that assumption and find out:  How accurate serology tests are. What antibody levels are needed for immunity? How long the immunity lasts.  Researchers hope to use antibody tests to learn how widely the coronavirus has spread and to nail down how deadly it is. A COVID-19 information letter is shown at a coronavirus evaluation clinic in Montreal on March 10. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) Experts say serology tests won't tell you how many antibodies your immune system has made in response to COVID-19. That's important because immunity often depends on having a high concentration of antibodies.  Health Canada said officials are being vigilant to ensure that serological testing is used appropriately, in conjunction with other laboratory tests. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid19-testing-explainer-1.5540418

As some provinces began opening up their economies from COVID-19 lockdowns, Trudeau said on Saturday none of those recovery plans hinge on people being immune to catching COVID-19 twice. Trudeau said he spoke to premiers Friday and they discussed a basic framework that provinces will use as they reopen businesses, schools and other institutions. The focus, he said, is on preventing the spread of the virus through physical distancing and personal protective equipment. ""It is very clear that the science is not decided on whether or not having had COVID once prevents you from having it again,"" he told reporters. ""It's something we need to get clearer answers to and until we get those clearer answers, we need to err on the side of more caution.""

Herd immunity is conferred when enough people in a given population have been infected with a virus, marking them immune to reinfection and slowing down the rate at which the virus spreads on its own.  ""The idea of ... generating natural immunity is actually not something that should be undertaken,"" Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said Saturday, urging people to be ""extremely cautious"" about the concept. Sask. and N.B. unveil multiphase plans As the global death toll from COVID-19 topped 200,000 on Saturday, countries and jurisdictions around the world took cautious steps toward easing some lockdowns, while fears of infection made even some pandemic-wounded businesses reluctant to reopen. At his regular news conference at Rideau Cottage on Saturday, Trudeau said any plans to reopen the economy will be based on science, data and expert advice. Trudeau said Canada shouldn't be reopening any sector without a plan to protect workers, which hinges on adequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE). He says planeloads of PPE are expected in the coming weeks, and domestic production will be on line soon.

Post-secondary students, who require access to their campus to fulfil their course requirements, will be able to do so, but elementary, middle and high schools won't reopen until at least September. Further steps would see the province eventually reopen elective surgeries, child-care facilities, barbers, churches and other facilities in stages over the coming weeks, as long as cases in the province remain low. $62.5M for fish and seafood sector Also Saturday, Trudeau announced $62.5 million to support fish and seafood processors.  The prime minister said the money will help processors buy personal protective equipment, adapt to new health protocols and support physical distancing.

43,[],"1 in 10 Canadians believes a coronavirus conspiracy theory, survey suggests",2020-04-24 8:00,Conspiracy theories around the origin of the coronavirus have been circulating since it was first identified. A preliminary study suggests that one in 10 Canadians believes at least one conspiracy theory about the virus.,"One in 10 Canadians believes a conspiracy theory about the novel coronavirus, according to preliminary research from the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec.  The researchers sent surveys to 600 people, half in Quebec and half in the rest of Canada, to ask about the psychological impacts of the pandemic.   Respondents were presented with six conspiracy theories and asked if they believe any of them. According to Marie-Eve Carignan, an associate professor at the University of Sherbrooke and one of the co-authors of the study, about 10 per cent of respondents believed at least one of the six theories. Carignan said that because the sample size is quite small, and due to the margin of error, 10 per cent may be a conservative estimate, and there can be a higher level of agreement on individual theories. She cautioned that the findings of the study are preliminary, and that team will have the results of a survey of 1,500 Canadians two weeks from now. Eventually their work will expand to include six countries.  Carignan said the six theories were:  My government is hiding important information about coronavirus. Coronavirus was intentionally made in a lab. Coronavirus was manufactured in a lab by mistake. The pharmaceutical industry is involved in the spread of the coronavirus. Coronavirus medication already exists. There's a link between 5G technology and the coronavirus.  One of the most popular conspiracy theories of the pandemic is that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was genetically engineered in a laboratory, possibly as a biological weapon. While just over half of those surveyed said they believe the virus occurred naturally, nearly a third said they believe it was created in a lab.  INTERACTIVECoronavirus tracker: 56,000+ cases in Canada on Saturday But virologists around the world say they would be able to tell if the virus has been modified in a lab, and there are no signs that is the case. It is possible the virus could have been studied in a lab and then leaked accidentally, but it's not probable, they say. The survey also found that around 15 per cent of respondents believe that the pharmaceutical industry is involved in the spread of the coronavirus.  No, the new coronavirus wasn't created in a lab, scientists say  Another popular theory links the virus with 5G wireless network technology. But Quebecers were less inclined to believe it than those outside the province: just 7.8 per cent of Quebec respondents, compared to 15 per cent of respondents in the rest of Canada.  Carignan says she's not sure why there's such a difference but speculated it could be that conspiracy theories that originate in English may not spread as well to French speakers, but she says the issue requires further study. The 5G conspiracy theory has gained traction this month: Google searches about 5G skyrocketed at the beginning of April, compared to the previous year. But any perceived link between 5G technology and the coronavirus has been thoroughly debunked. WATCH | Virologist explains why he is certain the pandemic was not caused by 5G Kindrachuk explains why he is certain the global pandemic has been caused by a virus and not 5G. 0:42 Roughly 38 per cent of respondents believe their government is hiding important information about the coronavirus. Carignan says that matters because people who are less likely to trust their government may be more likely to believe conspiracy theories.  Most common myths Meanwhile, a team at Ryerson University in Toronto has identified the most common types of disinformation related to COVID-19 by creating real-time dashboards that track the work done by fact-checkers around the world. The group looked at 2,000 debunked claims by fact-checkers and found seven prevalent types of disinformation, which are displayed on two dashboards — a global one and a Canadian one:    Fake tests and cures.   Speculation on the origin of the virus.   Unproven attributes of the virus.   Fake websites purporting to be authorities or government entities.   False claims about brands and their involvement with the virus.   Rumours about celebrities getting ill or dying from the virus.   Blaming certain ethnic groups or religions for spreading the virus.   Philip Mai, co-director of the Ryerson Social Media Lab and one of the researchers behind the dashboard, said that the team's work on misinformation in the political sphere showed them misinformation follows patterns. Helping people spot the patterns could help them recognize misinformation more easily.   Viral video claiming 5G caused pandemic easily debunked  ""We want to educate the public as to what to look for so that they can inoculate themselves against this kind of stuff, because there's only so many fact-checkers in the world,"" said Mai, adding that most people don't have the time to chase down every claim.   ""The idea is you can learn, arm yourself with information, so that next time you see a version of one of these types of misinformation, you can say, 'Oh, that sounds like something I've heard before, and I think that's not correct,'"" Mai said. ""At least it makes you question things as opposed to [hitting] that share button without thinking,"" said Mai.

Two seniors exercise in a park during a suspension of the curfew in Belgrade, as Serbian authorities eased some of the strict measures that have been in place against the pandemic. (Darko Vojinovic/The Associated Press) Putting off kids' vaccines during COVID-19 heightens risk of other outbreaks With daycares and schools closed across Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic, immunization requirements aren't being enforced by public health officials. That has doctors worried about a possible surge in measles, whooping cough and other serious, vaccine-preventable illnesses. The Canadian Paediatric Society is urging family physicians and other clinicians to ensure young patients don't miss their vaccines. Dr. Joan Robinson, a spokesperson for the society, said keeping children at home won't completely protect them from vaccine-preventable diseases. ""Meningitis can be acquired from a completely healthy child or adult who carries the bacteria in the nose or throat,"" said Robinson. Not all medical clinics and doctor's offices have the infrastructure or enough personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves and masks to offer routine vaccinations safely. Many clinics are closed altogether for the time being, amid quarantine measures imposed by the provinces and territories. Dr. Daniel Flanders, a pediatrician in Toronto, has come up with a creative way to inoculate his young patients: he is administering driveup vaccinations in the alley behind his office. Physicians and public health experts warn that a delay in immunizing even a small number of children heightens the risk of non-COVID outbreaks. Pediatricians say they understand if inoculations can't take place for a month or two. But once restrictions start to reach three months or more, they worry that the herd immunity rates that protect vulnerable individuals in the community could crumble. ""This pandemic is bad enough,"" Flanders said. ""If we layer on top of that vaccine-preventable infection outbreaks, that is really unthinkable."" The World Health Organization — which recently listed vaccine hesitancy as a global public health threat, along with pandemic — is equally concerned. The United Nations health body said Thursday that when immunization services are disrupted, even for brief periods during emergencies, then the risk increases for outbreaks of measles and polio.

The question of how and when to reopen is one being debated across Canada and in many regions of the world that have seen some progress in slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus. Some provinces, including hard-hit Quebec and Ontario, have been seeing hundreds of new cases daily, while others, including New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, have gone several days with no new cases. Trudeau stressed that ""getting back to normal will not happen overnight"" and will require co-ordination at the national level to ensure governments are working with similar principles and guidelines. On Thursday, Saskatchewan unveiled a multiphase plan to reopen, while New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs released early details of a phased reopening plan for that province this afternoon. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said his government will offer some details early next week about its opening plans. Read more about the situation in Canada Health experts reject Trump's suggestion to ingest disinfectant to kill COVID-19 Doctors and health experts urged people not to drink or inject disinfectant today after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested on Thursday that scientists should investigate inserting the cleaning agent into the body as a way to combat COVID-19. ""[This is an] absolutely dangerous, crazy suggestion,"" said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia. Reckitt Benckiser, which manufacturers household disinfectants Dettol and Lysol, said in a statement that ""under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body [through injection, ingestion or any other route]."" The White House said today that Trump had been taken out of context and had urged people to seek coronavirus treatment only after conferring with their doctors. Trump himself offered a different explanation from the White House while signing the latest coronavirus relief bill, stating he was being sarcastic. Read more reaction from experts  Canadian government offers rent relief for businesses Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today announced a new rent subsidy program to help businesses forced to shut down because of the global pandemic. The rent relief plan, to be funded jointly with the provinces, will provide non-repayable loans to commercial property owners to cover 50 per cent of rent payments for April, May and June. The loans will be forgiven if the property owner agrees to cut the rent by at least 75 per cent for those months and promises not to evict the tenant. The small business tenant must cover the remaining portion of the rent, which would be up to 25 per cent. To qualify, small business tenants must pay less than $50,000 a month in rent. They also must have experienced a revenue decline of at least 70 per cent from pre-COVID-19 levels or they must have been forced to close down because of pandemic restrictions. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) welcomed the rent relief program but warned that it may be too complicated and too reliant on landlords to administer. It also criticized the requirement that a qualifying business report a loss of 70 per cent of its revenues, saying that might disqualify some hard-hit businesses.

CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions, including this one, about the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have one of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: By definition, herd immunity evolves when a sufficient portion of the population becomes immune to a disease. When it comes to COVID-19, herd immunity means the virus would not be able to spread on its own, according to Erin Strumpf, a health economics expert at McGill University. ""It's not prevention of a disease, per se, but it's prevention of an epidemic."" Most experts suggest herd immunity cannot be achieved safely without a vaccine because seniors and other vulnerable populations with suppressed immune systems would be at risk and hospitals would be overwhelmed. Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, said herd immunity without a vaccine is ""theoretically possible"" if everyone, or almost everyone, who becomes infected develops antibodies that will protect them for life. While that might happen, ""we don't know that [yet],"" said McGeer. ""It would just be foolish to count on it, which is why we're working on vaccines."" AND FINALLY...

(Government of Newfoundland and Labrador) On Thursday the government of Newfoundland and Labrador announced 205 people have recovered from COVID-19 within the province — among them Bill Woolridge.  Woolridge joined Premier Dwight Ball, Health Minister John Haggie and Chief Medical Officer of Health Janice Fitzgerald on Thursday during the provincial government's daily COVID-19 update to tell his story about contracting the virus, his recovery and the challenges he faced through that difficult two-week period. Woolridge's coronavirus story relates to at least 176 other people affected by a funeral at Caul's Funeral Home in St. John's in mid-March for his brother-in-law, Edward Tobin.  ""He was buried from Caul's Funeral Home on March 17, after a funeral celebration from Caul's chapel. My first COVID-19 symptom occurred the evening of March 19,"" Woolridge said. It began with a headache, and a feeling of pressure on his forehead. Prone to sinus infections, Woolridge said the possibility of having COVID-19 didn't cross his mind. Then he started feeling fatigued.  On March 21, two days after beginning to feel unwell, Woolridge said his family received a call from a relative informing them someone who attended the funeral had tested positive for the virus.

""The World Health Assembly is coming up in May. There are opportunities to pursue that matter there and that is our first port of call,"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. Australia has overcome the worst of its coronavirus outbreak, which is why it has moved on to lobbying other countries to support its call for an inquiry, but it understood that other countries were still dealing with high death rates, government sources said. Looking for 'like-minded countries' Morrison has called leaders in France, Germany and the United States and is expected to lobby Britain and Canada as Australia seeks support from ""like-minded"" countries. AnalysisWhy Trump's re-election could hinge on a fight over the history of COVID-19 in the U.S.Trump's move to cut WHO funding prompts world condemnation France and Britain said on Wednesday it was not the time for an investigation. Morrison told reporters he understood hesitation about the timing and played down suggestions China would be targeted. ""Our purpose here is just pretty simple, we would like the world to be safer when it comes to viruses,"" he said. 'Obligations and responsibilities' Although the proposal would be for a broad review of the coronavirus outbreak and the WHO response, which could then propose ways to strengthen WHO powers, Morrison said he supported a weapons-inspector-style arrangement for health emergencies that countries would sign up to. The World Health Organization has taken heat from some countries over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, has promised a review when the crisis is over. (Salvatore Di Nolfi/AP) ""They don't have a roving commission to go anywhere they want in the world, but if you are going to be a member of a club like the World Health Organization, there should be obligations and responsibilities attached,"" he told a news conference. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the agency would carry out an ""after-action"" review when the crisis was over. Morrison told Australian broadcaster Sky that ""nothing was changed"" after the WHO held a review of an Ebola outbreak in Africa that critics said it handled poorly. 'A good record' Richard Maude, a former Australian diplomat and intelligence chief, said Australia had led coalitions of countries on issues including disarmament, non-proliferation and Russia's downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine. ""Australia has a good record of getting things done in multilateral processes, including the United Nations,"" said Maude, the executive director of policy at the Asia Society Australia. ""The problem for Australia right now is that while the objectives — greater transparency and learning lessons — are reasonable and important, the issue of the origins of the virus and the path of its transmission have become so caught up in geopolitics and deteriorating U.S.-China ties that China is very unlikely to co-operate."" China announces additional $30M in funding for WHO China has criticized Australia's call for an investigation as ""political manipulation"" and accused Australian lawmakers of parroting Trump. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne wrote in a newspaper column that no country would be singled out and the WHO's role should be reviewed because Australia wanted strong multilateral institutions.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/australia-who-coronavirus-pandemic-investigation-1.5542172

Of the new cases in the region, two are linked to seniors' facilities. One involves a staff member at a long-term care home, while the other involves a resident of a retirement home. Currently, eight seniors' homes in the region are battling outbreaks, according to the MLHU. The latest facility to declare one is Kensington Village Retirement, a home in the city's east end. Still, the health unit is not providing details on how many cases each facility has.

Email: Covid@cbc.ca  The federal government has announced a $1.1-billion plan to marshal Canada's scientific community in the fight against the coronavirus, as some provinces with relatively fewer cases begin to weigh how they will relax restrictions put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19. Scientists around the globe are scrambling to come up with tests, treatments to lessen the severity of the disease and ultimately, a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus that has killed more than 2,000 Canadians and almost 200,000 people worldwide. At his Thursday news conference outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was putting in place a three-point medical and research strategy. WATCH | Trudeau lays out the government's strategy: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1 billion strategy to fund COVID-19 medical research and a task force to study immunity. 3:53 This plan includes:  $155 million for research on vaccines and other treatments, support for clinical trials and expanding national testing and modelling.  $662 million for clinical trials led by Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling of COVID-19, including a COVID-19 immunity task force that includes Dr. David Naylor, Dr. Catherine Hankins, Dr. Tim Evans, Dr. Theresa Tam and Dr. Mona Nemer.  In mid-March, the Trudeau government committed $275 million for research, as part of the first emergency aid package. That was supplemented later in the month with the creation of a new strategic innovation fund, which provided another $192 million to specific companies and research institutions working on the development of drugs and vaccines.

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) As well, the government has provided $52 million through national granting councils to almost 100 research teams across the country. With several provinces beginning to talk cautiously about reopening the economy, which has been virtually shut down since mid-March, the pressure is on to find reliable, rapid tests to determine who is infected with the virus and who has developed immunity to it. Saskatchewan's reopening plan Saskatchewan became the first province Thursday to outline a concrete plan for how some businesses and services could be allowed to resume next month provided the number of cases there stays low.  Premier Scott Moe said restrictions will be lifted May 4 for dentists' offices, optometry clinics and physical therapy providers. Golf courses will reopen May 15 and retail shops selling clothing, books, flowers and sporting goods might be allowed to open their doors on May 19.

(Brian McInnis/CBC) Hairdressers and barbers could also start seeing clients again on May 19, but employees working directly with the public would have to wear masks. Physical distancing and strict cleanliness standards would have to be maintained through every phase.  For the next phases — for which there are no start dates yet — officials would consider lifting restrictions on indoor and outdoor recreational and entertainment facilities and bumping up the size of allowable gatherings to 30 people from the current 10. The final phase of the plan would include lifting restrictions on crowd sizes, visits to long-term care facilities and non-essential travel. Moe has already said those will stay put for some time. The government's plan doesn't provide a timeline for when gyms might be allowed to operate or when daycare capacity might be increased. Nor does it give a time frame for food services and restaurants to reopen, but when they do, they will be expected to operate at half their capacity. Prince Edward Island, where the COVID-19 caseload is low, is aiming to ease measures put in place to slow the spread in late April and reopen businesses in mid-May. 'Not exactly islands'  Dr. Craig Jenne, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Calgary, said easing restrictions in one province could present challenges for others. ""Many provinces in Canada have no hard borders,"" he said in an interview with The Canadian Press. ""Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba — we are not exactly islands where we can cut off travel between provinces. ""We are going to have to make sure we're on the same page with this."" 'Failing our parents, our grandparents': Trudeau Trudeau said the military will respond to provincial requests for assistance at long-term care facilities. But he said the measure is a short-term solution and that Canada should not need soldiers to take care of seniors. ""If you're angry, frustrated, scared, you're right to feel this way. We can do better. We need to do better. Because we are failing our parents, our grandparents, our elders."" WATCH | Should long-term care homes be federally regulated? Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with reporters on Thursday. 1:12 The comments today followed requests by Ontario and Quebec on Wednesday for hundreds of soldiers to help long-term care facilities that have been hit hard by COVID-19. The Canadian Armed Forces is now assessing what more it can provide to respond to these requests. Trudeau said the government is sending the military to help in long-term care homes in Ontario and Quebec — 130 troops were sent to help five long-term care facilities in Quebec last week — but said it should never have come to this, and there are tough questions to be asked once the crisis is over. The outbreak of COVID-19 in long-term care homes has outraged many Canadians and Trudeau said that outrage is not misplaced.

The report cited draft documents published accidentally by the World Health Organization. In a statement on Friday, Gilead said the post included inappropriate characterizations of the study and that the study was terminated early due to low enrolment and, as a result, it was underpowered to enable statistically meaningful conclusions.

(Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images) Still, a decision is likely months away as member countries disagree on how much financial aid should be given out.  Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands all opposed recovery aid through grants, while a broader northern camp — including Germany — were in favour of linking a new Recovery Fund to the bloc's next long-term budget for 2021-27, sources said.   EU holds critical virtual summit on setting yearslong budget in a time of pandemic   Hard-hit Italy called for a Recovery Fund of 1.5 trillion euros ($2.3 trillion Cdn) as well as grants to member states, while French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe's response required financial transfers to the hardest-hit states, and not just loans. Macron also said the European project had no future if member states failed to respond to the ""exceptional shock.""    The World Health Organization said it would announce a ""landmark collaboration"" on Friday to speed development of safe, effective drugs, tests and vaccines to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19. The Geneva-based agency, in a brief statement issued late on Thursday, said the initiative with partners aims to make technologies against the disease caused by the novel coronavirus ""accessible to everyone who needs them, worldwide,"" but gave no details. With more than 22,000 officially recorded deaths, officials in Spain are now preparing for rolling back some of the strict lockdown restrictions. The confinement has helped slow the daily contagion rate increase from more than 20 per cent to less than two per cent, although Spain has not been testing widely and the real contagion is believed to be higher.

South Korea's health authorities are planning to soon begin antibody tests to learn how widespread the coronavirus infection is within the population. They are also researching how long people maintain immunity after recovering from COVID-19.  South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government will allow a partial reopening of the economy on May 1, with travel restrictions eased and some industries allowed to operate under a five-level risk system. International borders will remain closed while travel will be only allowed for essential services.

(Submitted by Shuwei Zhu) How the pandemic gives some states political cover for controversial acts For many governments, the pandemic crisis presents the perfect cover for carrying out actions they could only dream of before the virus struck. Around the time people first started falling ill in Hubei province, the Communist Party of China was wrestling with the difficult question of how to respond to voters in Hong Kong massively rejecting pro-Beijing candidates in local elections. Last Saturday, with the COVID-19 pandemic now a global concern, China's new top official in Hong Kong arrested 15 major pro-democracy figures. ""They've been wanting to make these arrests for a long time,"" said Lynette Ong, who teaches political science at the University of Toronto's Asian Institute. ""They know the rest of the world's attention is on coronavirus."" In Hungary, debate was muted when Prime Minister Viktor Orban proposed a new law that would suspend parliament, stop all elections and allow him to rule by decree that his party-dominated parliament later passed. Orban said the measure was necessary to allow the government to act swiftly to ""save lives"" in a pandemic, but given Orban's history of methodically dismantling Hungary's democracy and institutions, most human rights groups predict his new powers will be used against anyone who criticizes the government's handling of the pandemic. Many governments have introduced new restrictions on speech in the name of combatting ""misinformation"" about the novel coronavirus. (The Trudeau government also has flirted with the idea.) In many cases, the ""misinformation"" governments are concerned about is anything that calls into question their own responses to the pandemic. In Turkmenistan, a hermetic police state dominated by President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov's cult of personality, saying the word ""coronavirus"" or wearing a mask in public can lead to arrest, according to Reporters Without Borders. Click below to watch more from The National Doctors working with COVID-19 patients say the virus may cause a deadly immune response called a cytokine storm in some patients. A team of Canadian scientists are leading research on how it could be treated. 2:01 IN BRIEF Trudeau announces $1.1B scientific strategy to fight COVID-19 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1.1-billion strategy for medical research to fight COVID-19. The plan has three components:  $115 million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities. $662 million for clinical trials in Canada. $350 million to expand national testing and modelling for COVID-19.  Trudeau also announced the creation of a new COVID-19 immunity task force focused on serology testing — blood-based tests used to determine if someone has been exposed to the virus. Trudeau said the task force will work to determine how many people have COVID-19 beyond those who already have been tested, whether those who've recovered are immune and, if so, how long that immunity might last. Today's measures support previous efforts by the Trudeau government to marshal Canada's scientific community in the battle against COVID-19. Scientists around the globe are scrambling to come up with tests and treatments to limit the disease and, ultimately, a vaccine to protect against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 Canadians and almost 200,000 people worldwide. Read more about the scientific strategy  Saskatchewan unveils 5-stage plan to reopen its economy in May The Saskatchewan government today unveiled its five-phase plan to reopen the province, with the first phase set to begin on May 4. ""Over the next several weeks, restrictions will be gradually lifted by adding more types of businesses to the allowable businesses list, meaning that they can reopen if they so choose,"" Premier Scott Moe said in a news release. Phase 1 will see restrictions lifted on certain medical practices — including dentistry, optometry, physical therapy and more — alongside a focus on outdoor recreation. Phase 2, set to begin May 19, will include the opening of retail businesses and personal services not initially allowed under Saskatchewan's state of emergency. Dates for the other phases are still pending. Businesses are expected to continue practising physical distancing and implement screening measures if physical distancing is not possible. Long-term restrictions on high-risk areas remain in place, including maintaining the current state of emergency and recommendations against non-essential international and interprovincial travel. Read more about the five-phase plan  No more middle seats? Airlines ponder new normal of flying Airlines like United, Delta, EasyJet and others have announced plans to do away with the middle seat in their economy class cabins during the COVID-19 pandemic. It's the latest move in the aviation industry's attempts to deal with the coronavirus, which has walloped this industry harder than perhaps any other. While sure to be welcomed by economy class passengers who have spent years squeezed into smaller and smaller spaces, the promise to no longer get stuck in a middle seat is largely symbolic, as the number of flights around the world has plummeted by 70 per cent since the start of the crisis, says the International Air Transport Association (IATA). But how long will it last? The industry as a whole is clearly looking ahead to the future of air travel once the crisis passes, but not all airlines are entertaining the notion that it's feasible to get rid of middle seats. Irish discount airline RyanAir is able to offer rock-bottom prices precisely because it crams in as many passengers as possible, and CEO Michael O'Leary said the idea of keeping middle seats permanently empty is ""nonsense."" Read more about airlines' plans amid the pandemic   THE SCIENCE Can I contract the virus in a swimming pool? CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions, including this one, about the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have one of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: Experts say it is unlikely someone can become infected with the coronavirus by swimming in a pool. ""There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can survive in pools that are properly monitored and treated"" with routine measures like chlorine and bromine, said Dr. Ilan Schwartz, infectious disease clinician and assistant professor at the University of Alberta. The risk of transmission is from inhaling droplets produced from coughing, sneezing or talking — all of which require people being relatively close to each other. ""It's not so much the pool that gives the risk of transmission,"" said Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious diseases physician at Trillium Health Partners, but ""rather, being in close proximity to someone else who may be infected."" The water itself would not be a risk in transmission, he added. However, health officials are still recommending that people physically distance and stay home as much as possible. As well, public pools are closed and most condo boards have also closed their amenities to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. AND FINALLY... This man has 3D-printed almost 700 face shields for health-care workers across Ontario Lucas K. Labrecque of Chatham, Ont., said he wanted to find some way to help during the COVID-19 pandemic, so he took to his 3D printer and began mass producing face shields. (Submitted by Lucas K. Labrecque) After seeing news stories highlighting the dangers of coronavirus, as well as the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) in certain communities, Lucas K. Labrecque of Chatham, Ont., started 3D-printing medical face shields in the hope of distributing them to front-line care workers. Using a technique called stack printing, the freelance television producer said he was able to mass produce stacks of face shield bands that can be taken apart and assembled with ease. Once the bands have been printed, he simply uses plastic book covers to serve as the protective component. Labrecque said he reaches out directly to the health-care workers who need PPE most, which he's able to do thanks to a network of friends and other contacts he's been able to make. So far, he's delivered almost 700 face shields to staff in Chatham, Blenheim, Woodstock, Hamilton, Lindsay, Bobcaygeon, Ottawa and parts of the Haldimand-Dunnville-Niagara region.

One analysis of government data on deaths suggested the COVID-19 toll could be much higher than the official tally.","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday faced a call for an inquiry into his Conservative government's handling of the coronavirus crisis after failing to fully explain partial death data, limited testing or the lack of equipment for hospitals. The novel coronavirus outbreak, the worst health crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic, has left governments across the world grappling with stressed populations, a stalled global economy and overloaded health services. Johnson initially refrained from approving the stringent controls that other European leaders imposed, but he later closed down the country when projections showed a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, a Financial Times analysis of statistics office data suggests the novel coronavirus outbreak has caused as many as 41,000 deaths in the United Kingdom. The FT extrapolation is based on the number of all fatalities in official data recorded recently that have exceeded the usual average, including deaths that occurred outside hospitals. The number of people who have died in hospitals in the United Kingdom after testing positive for the coronavirus has risen to 18,100 as of Tuesday at 4 p.m. local tome, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday, an increase of 763 on the figures published 24 hours earlier. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 — the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus — had risen to 133,495, it added. 'Hybrid Parliament' British lawmakers upended 700 years of history by grilling stand-in leader Dominic Raab by video link in an unprecedented but largely successful ""hybrid Parliament"" session forced by the coronavirus outbreak. A maximum of 50 lawmakers are physically allowed in the debating chamber, with another 120 permitted to join in via Zoom video conference. Lawmakers at home, dressed formally in line with the usual dress code for the Commons, quizzed Raab, who was in the chamber, on the government's response.

""Once we are through this crisis, there will of course need to be an independent inquiry to officially review the government's response to the pandemic,"" Ed Davey, acting leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats, said in a statement. ""The inquiry must have the strongest possible powers given the shocking failures on protective equipment for staff and the slow response of the government — to get to the truth and to give Boris Johnson the opportunity to answer the increasingly serious questions."" Raab rejected the call for inquiry. ""I have to say I won't take up his offer of committing to a public inquiry. I think that there are definitely lessons to be learned and when we get through this crisis it will be important that we take stock,"" he said.

So far,slightly more than 18,200 tests are being done per day. He said Wednesday the government would bring in large-scale contact-tracing once the number of new cases of the coronavirus falls. ""As we have reached the peak, as we bring the number of new cases down, so we will introduce contact tracing at large scale,"" Hancock told Parliament.

Britain did not join an EU-wide program to buy ventilators, even though it is eligible to. (Steve Parsons/PA/The Associated Press) There has also been confusion over ventilators. The top official in Britain's foreign ministry said on Tuesday he had been mistaken when he told a committee of lawmakers the government had made a political decision not to participate in a European scheme to buy ventilators to fight the coronavirus. Johnson battled grave COVID-19 complications in intensive care earlier this month. A report in the most recent Sunday Times indicated that Johnson missed five consecutive meetings on the coronavirus before the pandemic hit Britain with force. Parliament later approved an expansion of the business the hybrid sessions could consider to include legislation. It also agreed to allow remote voting for the first time ever — although the way in which this would be conducted has yet to be agreed and no votes are expected until it has been. Government disputes analysis of total deaths The analysis of excess deaths in the Financial Times said the true death toll from COVID-19 is likely to be more than double this, based on the FT's analysis of excess deaths in recent data. On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that 18,516 people died in England and Wales in the week ending April 10, or 7,966 more than the five-year average.  External link: See the Financial Times' analysis  While the ONS records mentions of COVID-19 in death certificates, the sheer volume of extra total deaths — including those that do not mention COVID-19 — means that the true toll from the disease is being undercounted, according to the FT analysis. This indicates the ""real"" death toll from the coronavirus is now running around 41,000. The ONS data on Tuesday provided concrete examples of the under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths. The statistics showed deaths in care homes had doubled over recent weeks, but only 17 per cent of the death certificates mentioned COVID-19. WATCH: Navigating tight situations in public Physical distancing has radically changed how we socialize. But there’s still some scenarios where it’s difficult to limit our physical contact with others. Here’s how to best navigate them. 3:23 Cambridge professor David Spiegelhalter told the FT that it was not credible that these extra deaths could mostly come as a result of indirect effects from the coronavirus lockdown, such as seriously ill people avoiding hospital. ""There is no suggestion that the collateral damage — however large it is — is anything like as big as the harm from COVID,"" Spiegelhalter said. Hancock told reporters that the 40 per cent gap between the daily data and the more comprehensive ONS data was ""not an accurate representation of those figures.""

INTERACTIVE | See the latest data on coronavirus cases in Canada.  Canada hit a grim milestone Wednesday as the number of deaths across the country from COVID-19 exceeded 2,000, and later the number of overall cases topped 40,000. More than half of the deaths have come in long-term care homes, which have been hard hit by the pandemic, particularly in Quebec and Ontario.  The news came as Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced he will be calling in the military to help deal with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis in the province's long-term care homes.  Ford says he will formally request extra resources from the federal government today, including from the Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Forces personnel, specifically to help in five priority homes. He compared the situation in long-term care settings to a ""raging wildfire"" during his Wednesday news conference. Canadian Forces personnel have already been deployed to Quebec to help out in the hard hit long-term care facilities there. On Wednesday, Premier François Legault said he's asked the federal government to send 1,000 additional soldiers to help staff the  institutions. Legault told reporters at his daily briefing that he made the request because the province has not been able to find enough trained workers to meet the system's immediate needs, even after bringing in 350 medical specialists, as well as other nurses from elsewhere and nursing students. A member of the Canadian Armed Forces arrives at Residence Yvon-Brunet a long term care home in Montreal on Saturday. Premier François Legault said he has asked the federal government to send another 1,000 soldiers. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press) The number of residences in Quebec considered to be in a ""critical situation"" nearly doubled in the past week, going from 41 to 80.  In all, approximately 850 of the 1,041 people who have died from COVID-19 in Quebec were residents of CHSLDs or seniors' homes. In Ontario, 128 residences are currently dealing with active COVID-19 outbreaks. As of today, there have been at least 448 deaths in long-term care amid outbreaks at 127 facilities. Ontario is also expanding COVID-19 testing to every resident and worker in long-term care homes. Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician at Toronto's Sinai Health System, says testing is only one part of the problem. ""We can test everyone and have the info to show the extent of the problem, but can you actually act on that information?"" he said in an interview with CBC News. ""Do you actually have the space to isolate people so that you're not causing more spread within the home? ""Do you have the personal protective equipment to support having staff members go between residents' rooms? Do you have the health and human resources to provide the care that they need?"" WATCH | Dr. Nathan Small says not enough attention was given to long-term care homes during pandemic planning.  Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician from Sinai Health System, says there wasn't enough attention paid to long-term care residences during pre-pandemic planning. 1:16 Speaking at the daily briefing by cabinet members and federal health officials, Tam again said that continued vigilance is essential and highlighted the continued concern around long-term care facilities. ""As we continue to make progress in slowing the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing some bumps in the road that remind us we can't let down our guard.""

Trudeau last week said the federal government was planning to consult with the provinces on topping-up wages of lower paid essential workers, but it's not yet clear how or when that might happen.

""We recognize that different provinces will make different decisions about how and where to start restarting and reopening their economies,"" Trudeau said Wednesday during his daily briefing.

WATCH | Ontario calls for military help for long-term care: Ontario has called for the military to help with the COVID-19 crisis in long-term care homes as it also implements increased testing in the facilities. 2:03 A federal official Wednesday expressed concerns that Indigenous communities will face elevated risks of COVID-19 infections once provinces and urban centres begin easing lockdown restrictions.  Valerie Gideon, senior assistant deputy minister for the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, says COVID-19 rates in Indigenous communities are currently running below the national percentage due to protection efforts.  ""There are communities that are 20 minutes from an urban centre. Some communities are in the middle of an urban centre. It is impossible for those communities to be completely closed off if cities decide to open up their operations."" Trudeau's remarks come a day after Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam made similar remarks. Tam, who was speaking at a daily briefing on Tuesday, urged continued vigilance around public health measures and said steps taken by Canadians across the country to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus have prevented an explosion of cases.  Tam said Tuesday that health officials across the country are closely monitoring for ""continued and stable slowing of the epidemic"" as they plan for what comes next. ""But we are still a ways off and the path remains uncertain,"" Tam said, adding that she knows questions around recovery and what comes next are on everyone's mind. While there are a lot of unknowns about the path forward, Tam said the actions Canadians have taken in recent weeks have been critical to slowing the spread of the virus. ""There is no doubt that our sacrifices and every day inconveniences over the past weeks have prevented an explosive outbreak in Canada like the ones that have overwhelmed health-care systems in places like Italy, Spain and New York.""  'We have a whole globe to protect': Pandemic vaccine research speeds up Why COVID-19 may attack the body differently than we think  The virus, which was first identified in China in late 2019, causes an illness called COVID-19. There's no proven treatment or vaccine for the virus, though researchers around the world are searching for potential treatments.  Support for students Strict public health measures meant to clamp down on the virus have led to huge financial strain for families and businesses, as well as for governments tasked with overseeing the response and assisting those who have lost income. The federal government and provinces have launched a range of initiatives aimed at supporting families and businesses, but some critics argue that the funding has been both too narrow and too slow. Trudeau on Wednesday said the government plans to roll out funding and expanded job placement programs for post-secondary students who are struggling to find enough work during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has left thousands of Canadians infected and prompted health officials to introduce a range of measures aimed at keeping people home.

Spaniards optimistic nightmare is easing As his left-wing coalition marked 100 days in office, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez sought parliamentary approval to prolong a state of emergency until May 9 — the third such extension.

Customers line up outside a Costco in Burnaby, B.C., as the store enforces physical distancing measures. (Ben Nelms/CBC) Inside Canada's frayed pandemic early warning system and its COVID-19 response As COVID-19 quietly incubated in Wuhan, China, last fall, public health officials in Canada were looking for gaps that needed to be closed in their long effort to upgrade this country's online pandemic early warning system. Few people outside a tight circle of highly specialized epidemiologists and federal bureaucrats had ever heard of the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) before the novel coronavirus became a global pandemic. The online, multilingual monitoring and analysis unit, which scours the internet for media reports of infectious diseases, has been a crucial pandemic tripwire for both Canada and the World Health Organization (WHO). Records obtained by CBC News show GPHIN was in the middle of a long-overdue technology upgrade as the virus was spreading. Despite almost four years of work with the National Research Council of Canada, the early warning system was — as of last fall — still in need of ""improvement in the geographical and time tagging algorithm,"" according to a Nov. 12, 2019, presentation to a WHO conference in Seoul by senior epidemiologist Florence Tanguay. It is difficult to understate the importance of the Canadian network, said one of the country's leading intelligence experts. ""The Global Public Health Intelligence Network was meant to perform a critical warning task with regard to the COVID-19 ... outbreak. This was its job,"" said Wesley Wark, a University of Ottawa professor. ""It should have been at the heart of a Canadian and indeed a global early warning system."" Created in 1997, GPHIN is credited with helping spot the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks. During those previous outbreaks, the network issued rolling email alerts to those governments and the WHO as the viruses it was tracking appeared in new countries. The documents obtained by CBC News raise questions about whether that practice of issuing specific alerts was followed in the case of COVID-19. The decision to issue those warnings would have been up to PHAC.

Legault said he made the request because the province has not been able to find enough trained workers to meet the system's immediate needs, even after bringing in 350 medical specialists, as well as other nurses from elsewhere and nursing students, to ease the staffing crisis. The challenge, said Legault, is finding health-care workers able to work full-time at the same long-term care facility for at least a two-week period. Legault said there are now ""two worlds"" in the province. One is in long-term care homes, known as CHSLDs, where the situation remains critical. But outside the CHSLDs — and outside the greater Montreal region, which is the epicentre of the pandemic in Quebec — the situation is improving. ""We're moving in the right direction,"" he said. Read more about the situation in Quebec  Trudeau announces $9B in financial aid for students struggling because of pandemic Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today announced $9 billion in financial aid for post-secondary students, pending Parliament's approval, in response to claims that too many young people were falling through the cracks in existing COVID-19 support programs. Under the proposed program, students would be eligible for $1,250 a month from May through August. That sum can go up to $1,750 if the student is taking care of someone or has a disability. The benefit would also be available to students who have jobs but are making less than $1,000 a month, and payments would be made through the Canada Revenue Agency. As well, the prime minister said the federal government is doubling student grants for eligible students — up to $6,000 for full-time students and up to $3,600 for part-time students. Trudeau also announced more than $75 million in additional supports for Indigenous post-secondary students and raised the maximum weekly amount that can be provided through the Canada student loans program in 2020-2021 from $210 to $350.

At the heart of Ramadan is the sunrise-to-sunset fast, but the month traditionally sweeps everyone up into a communal spirit as families and friends gather for large meals at sunset, known as iftars. Many countries have closed mosques and banned evening prayers to prevent crowds, while prominent clerics have urged people to pray at home. ""In light of COVID-19, we've had to become creative,"" said Ali Chahbar, an outreach co-ordinator for the London Muslim Mosque in London, Ont. The London Muslim Mosque's Imam Amin Al-Ali has been releasing daily videos offering spiritual guidance.

CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions, including this one, about the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have one of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: Earlier this week, Cargill temporarily closed its High River, Alta., meat-processing plant after one worker died and hundreds more became ill. Is the meat from this plant at risk? Likely not, since COVID-19 is not a foodborne illness. According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, there have been no reported cases of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of the coronavirus. ""The virus is passed through person-to-person contact,"" said Siyun Wang, associate professor at the faculty of land and food systems at the University of British Columbia. ""What happened in the meat-packing plant in Alberta was also due to person-to-person contact."" This means it's unlikely any consumers could be at risk. Jeffrey Farber, director of the Canadian Research Institute for Food Safety and a professor at the University of Guelph, says while it is ""theoretically possible,"" the actual risk is ""extremely low."" So what happens if a droplet manages to land on your meat? Farber said the period of time it takes for that product to reach your dinner plate would also result ""in a further reduction in any viral particles that may be present."" Cooking meat also destroys the virus. AND FINALLY...

She created a mask adorned with beaded strawberries, cedar and spruce needles in the traditional Haudenosaunee raised beading style. The mask also says ""C-19 2020"" to commemorate the pandemic. Thompson said she believes that this is a time for reflection and that there are good things coming out of the situation like families coming together and people taking more control over their lives and the food they bring into their homes.

Professor Markus Buehler at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his team used artificial intelligence to transform a model of the protein structure of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus is formally called, into interwoven melodies in a classical musical composition. Researchers assigned each amino acid — the building blocks of the protein — a unique note. An algorithm then converted these notes into music. Buehler believes the tune offers a more intuitive way for people to comprehend the protein. ""You would need many different images, many different magnifications to see with your eyes, what your ears can pick up with just a couple of seconds of music,"" Buehler said. Listeners call music 'soothing,' 'scary' The composition runs nearly an hour and 50 minutes and has been uploaded to the SoundCloud website. The early part of composition has been described by several SoundCloud listeners as ""soothing"" and ""beautiful.""

Several likened the composition to a single, called Virus, from Icelandic artist Björk's 2011 album Biophilia.  Buehler said the music might help researchers design an antibody. Researchers could take a musical counterpoint to the virus' melody and rhythm and, using artificial intelligence again, try to find an antibody that matches it. The rapid spread of the coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, has made it important to ""open our brains to other ways of processing information,"" Buehler said.

Here's a look at what's happening in the U.S. From The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 4:30 p.m. ET U.S. President Donald Trump announced Tuesday he will be placing a 60-day pause on the issuance of certain immigration green cards in an effort to limit competition for jobs in a U.S. economy wrecked by the coronavirus. He told reporters during the White House briefing that the move would not impact those in the country on a temporary basis and would apply only to those looking for green cards in hopes of staying. Much of the immigration system has already ground to a halt because of the pandemic. Almost all visa processing by the State Department has been suspended for weeks. Travel to the U.S. has been restricted from much of the globe, including China, Europe, Mexico and Canada. And Trump has used the virus to effectively end asylum at U.S. borders, turning away even children who arrive by themselves — something Congress, the courts and international law hadn't previously allowed. The U.S. is now reporting more COVID-19 cases than any other country in the world, with more than 800,000 Americans infected, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 45,000 have died.  Trump says he will suspend all immigration into U.S. over coronavirus Protests highlight growing U.S. unease over coronavirus lockdowns  With health authorities and many governors warning that far more testing is needed before the U.S. economy can be safely reopened, New York state launched the nation's most ambitious effort yet to screen the general population for exposure to the virus. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said testing has to get up to scale before reopening can happen, adding that he was aware some people were unhappy they had to wear masks or engage in physical distancing. ""It's not a question of happy — it's a question of life and death."" At least three more states — South Carolina, Colorado and Georgia — have moved to loosen restrictions on commerce. Stay-at-home orders and widespread business closures imposed in most states to slow the spread of the virus have stifled the U.S. economy and thrown at least 22 million people out of work, a level of unemployment not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Santa Clara County officials said Tuesday the people died at home Feb. 6 and Feb. 17. Before this, the first U.S. death from the virus had been reported on Feb. 29 in Kirkland, Wash. Officials in Santa Clara said they received confirmation Tuesday that tissue samples sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested positive for the virus ""Today, the medical examiner-coroner received confirmation from the CDC that tissue samples from both cases are positive for SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19],"" the Santa Clara County medical examiner-coroner said in a statement. The announcement came after California Gov. Gavin Newsom promised a ""deep dive"" update Wednesday of the state's ability to test for the coronavirus and to track and isolate people who have it, one of the six indicators he says is key to lifting a ""stay-at-home"" order that has slowed the spread of the disease while forcing millions of people to file for unemployment benefits.

Still, Newsom warned that the state was not on the verge or re-opening soon.   ""I wish i could prescribe a specific date, to say 'Well we can turn out the light switch and go back to normalcy,'"" Newsom said.

Still, in a state of nearly 40 million people, that's not enough for public health officials to know for sure the reach of the highly contagious virus that is still causing outbreaks across the state in nursing homes and homeless shelters. Newsom said he wants the state to test at least 25,000 people per day by the end of April. Over the weekend, the California Department of Public Health issued new testing guidance that, for the first time, recommends testing for people in high-risk settings even if they do not have symptoms. The new advice is aimed at hospitals, jails and homeless shelters — three places where physical distancing is difficult.

Over the seven-day period ending on Sunday night, the number of deaths in California nearly doubled, and the number of new cases increased by nearly 50 per cent, state data showed. There have been more than 45,000 deaths in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.

She said those would likely be the first to see a lifting in distancing restrictions at the direction of their governors under the guidelines. But participants in a Wednesday call with Trump that included executives of dozens of leading American companies raised concerns about the testing issue, according to one participant who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private discussion. 'Economy will look very different' Another participant said it was stressed to Trump that expansion of testing and contact tracing was crucial, as well as guidelines for best practices on reopening businesses in phases or in one fell swoop. The participant said those on the call noted to the administration that there was about to be a rush on personal protective equipment. Many businesses that are now shuttered will need the protective equipment to keep their employees and customers safe. Trump was told ""the economy will look very different and operations will look very different,"" one participant said. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican close to Trump, said the lack of widespread testing was an impediment to lifting the distancing guidelines. ""We are struggling with testing at a large scale.,"" he told ABC's The View. ""You really can't go back to work until we have more tests.""

""That is a catastrophic outcome for our country. Period,"" Moore said he advised the president. ""We can't have 30 million people in this country unemployed or you're going to have social chaos."" The panel, which Trump dubbed the new Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups, also could help give him a measure of cover.

Stay-at-home measures, which experts say are essential to slow the spread of the virus, have ground the economy to a virtual standstill and forced more than 22 million people to apply for unemployment benefits in the past month. In Pennsylvania — where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has promised to veto a Republican-backed bill that would force him to reopen some businesses — a few hundred protesters, most of them in cars, held a demonstration in Harrisburg, the capital. Many of the protesters expressed cynicism toward health experts and skepticism about the actual scale of the pandemic in the country, accusing officials of overreaching and taking actions that had caused more harm than the virus itself. ""All the projections were wrong, but we are still telling people to stay home and businesses to close. This is not quarantine, this is tyranny,"" said Mark Cooper, a 61-year-old retired truck driver. U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican seeking re-election in November, has said state governors should have the final say but has favoured an early end to the lockdowns, and many protesters in the past week have sported pro-Trump signs and campaign gear. Demonstrators protest during a 'Reopen Maryland' rally outside the State House in Annapolis, Maryland. Some of those protesters have said the economic restriction and stay-at-home orders made to combat the COVID-19 pandemic are having worse effects than the disease itself.  (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) Republican lawmakers in several states have also backed the protesters, some of whom have failed to wear face masks or practise the social distancing that health officials say are key to getting the virus under control. ""The Democratic governors are just trying to kill the economy to hurt Trump,"" said Joe Buchert, a 48-year old retired police officer who was wearing a red Trump 2020 hat. Meanwhile in Washington, lawmakers were squabbling over a possible $450 billion US-plus deal to provide more aid to small businesses and hospitals hurt by the crisis. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said a vote could take place on Tuesday. Congress last month passed a $2.3 trillion aid package that included a small-business loan program. The Trump administration wants to add $250 billion to that now-depleted program, while Democrats have pushed for including funding for state and municipal governments and food aid for the poor. Fears of resurgence  Health experts and lawmakers on the front lines of the battle to curb the pandemic have warned that the country could face a second and even deadlier wave of infections if the lockdowns end prematurely. The United States has by far the world's largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 776,000 infections and over 41,000 deaths as of 4:30 p.m. ET. Nearly half of them are in the state of New York, according to a Johns Hopkins tally. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said testing capacity had to be ramped up and that reopening the economy in New York and other parts of the country would need to be calibrated carefully to prevent another surge in cases. ""You don't need protests to convince anyone in this country that we have to get back to work and we have to get the economy going and we have to get out of our homes. Nobody,"" Cuomo told a briefing. ""The question is going to become: how, when, how fast and what do we mean in terms of reopening.""

(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) Earlier, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it could take weeks if not months before the country's most populous city reopens due to a lack of widespread testing, even as officials elsewhere began rolling back restrictions on daily life. ""The federal government is not stepping up,"" de Blasio told a news conference. He said the city needed to be conducting hundreds of thousands of tests a day and to see hospitalizations decline further before the economy reopens. 'Dangerous political game' Trump, who has sparred with a number of Democratic governors critical of his response to the health crisis, has said there were enough tests for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. In a series of tweets on Monday, Trump said governors had shifted from complaining about a scarcity of ventilators to griping about not having what they needed to ramp up testing capacity, while he accused them of ""playing a very dangerous political game."" ""Now they scream 'Testing, Testing, Testing,' again playing a very dangerous political game. States, not the Federal Government, should be doing the Testing - But we will work with the Governors and get it done,"" he said in a tweet. Pro-Trump protesters rally against governors over stay-at-home ordersWe won't let COVID-19 measures strip our freedoms away, says U.S. protester White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said ramping up testing was the top item on the administration's agenda.

Residents in Florida were allowed to return to some beaches after Gov. Ron DeSantis said some restrictions could be relaxed. Charlie Latham, mayor of Jacksonville Beach, Fla., said the beach there was reopened with limited hours, and it went well with no arrests for people violating social distancing rules which barred chairs and blankets. ""We thought that the public was ready to maintain the social  distancing standards and to exercise good judgment. And it's paid off, it's paid off really well,"" Latham told Fox News.

The measures, which include the closures of most workplaces and schools and are called a ""circuit breaker"" by authorities, were initially set to run until May 4. The city-state reported 1,111 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, bringing total infections to 9,125, after a record daily jump of 1,426 cases on Monday. ""We will therefore extend the circuit breaker for four more weeks,"" Lee said in a televised speech. Lee said the extended lockdown period would help bring community cases down decisively and make sure infections in migrant dormitories do not spread into the wider community. Singapore's finance minister said at a media conference that the government would extend economic support measures, including wage subsidies, to help businesses offset the impact of the longer lockdown period. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong provides an update Tuesday on the COVID-19 situation in the city-state. Singapore extended its partial lockdown nearly a month. (Singapore Ministry of Communication and Information via AP) The World Health Organization's regional chief said on Tuesday that Singapore — which has the highest number of reported cases in Southeast Asia — is facing ""very difficult challenges"" from a recent surge in infections but has the health-care system and risk management capacity to handle it. The city-state has seen a sharp jump in cases in recent weeks fuelled by infections in cramped migrant worker dormitories, many of which are under government-ordered quarantines. 'Everyone is scared' For Habibur Rahman, the only glimpse of life outside the four walls of the cramped Singapore dormitory room he shares with 11 other migrant workers are security guards urging people to stay apart and cleaners scrubbing down communal toilets. The 25-year-old Bangladeshi is one of thousands of workers, mainly from South Asia, who came to Singapore to provide a better life for their families. Now, however, they are under government-ordered quarantine, battling boredom, frustration and anxiety in a sprawling dormitory complex called S11 at Punggol, home to about 2,000 of the overall cases. ""If one is infected, it would easily spread among others,"" Rahman said. ""Currently we are confined to our room. Everyone is scared. We are just praying to Allah … praying five times a day."" S11 is one of many utilitarian housing blocks on the fringes of the modern city-state where more than 300,000 migrant labourers from Bangladesh, India and China live in rooms with bunks for 12 to 20 men, working jobs that pay as little as $20 Cdn a day. These dormitories, in areas tourists seldom visit, account for more than 75 per cent of the country's total infections after the city-state recorded its biggest jump in new cases on Monday. Nineteen dormitories have been quarantined so far, according to government notices, affecting tens of thousands of workers. Workers in the dormitory at S11 said they leave their rooms only to use the bathroom, and meals are delivered.    (Ministry of Manpower Singapore/Reuters) Rights groups have said the dormitories have highlighted a weak link in Singapore's containment effort, which has otherwise won global plaudits. And critics say such mass quarantines could increase the risk of infection in the blocks. Singapore authorities say that they have taken preventative measures in migrant housing since the start of the city-state's outbreak in January but that the quarantine measures were necessary once the virus spread. S11, the company that operates the dormitory, the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters spoke with 12 residents at the S11 complex, a row of low-rise steel buildings of different colours behind high metal fences. Some workers declined to be identified for fear it would worry their families or put their jobs at risk. The workers said they leave their rooms only to use the bathroom, and meals are delivered. Their days are spent streaming movies on their phones, peering out of balconies draped with laundry, or chatting with concerned family members back home, they said. Fear of the virus Some S11 residents complained about the sanitation, the lack of precautions and monotony in the dormitories. Others praised the Singapore government's response. But all were afraid of catching the virus. For Nayem Ahmed, a 26-year old construction worker from Bangladesh, that fear was realized. One of his roommates had been infected, so when he awoke on April 8 feeling feverish, he immediately alerted medical staff in the dormitory. They tested him and while he awaited the results, he said, he was moved to an isolation facility outside the dormitory. Two days later, he was told he had been infected. 'A new life' ""I can't express how I felt when I heard that. I thought I would not live anymore,"" Ahmed said. Ahmed said he was given paracetemol, and underwent blood tests and a chest X-ray in a hospital. After a few days, he was moved to a converted conference centre called Expo, which is being used to house patients with mild symptoms. ""I feel like I have got a new life,"" Ahmed said. Migrant workers queue to collect food at the Punggol S11 dormitory during the coronavirus outbreak. Workers told Reuters that despite the outbreak, precautions are not as strict as they could be. (Edgar Su/Reuters) Ahmed said he is thankful to the Singapore government for providing health care and food, and making sure quarantined workers are paid. But he said more should have been done to address the risks of outbreaks in dormitories. ""Dormitories are crowded and dirty. No wonder the dormitories have become a hotbed for coronavirus infection,"" Ahmed said. ""Now we are paying the price."" Other workers also flagged hygiene issues in the dormitories shortly after quarantine measures were announced on April 5. The Ministry of Manpower has said it faced ""challenges"" at the start of the quarantine related to hygiene and the supply of food in the dormitories, but that it had been working with operators to improve conditions. S11, which operates the Punggol facility and another near the city's airport, advertises the ""cheapest dormitories in Singapore."" The dormitory at Punggol can house up to 14,000 workers in four-story buildings on about 5.8 hectares, roughly the same area as eight soccer pitches, according to local media reports. There are 43 such purpose-built dormitories in Singapore, housing 200,000 workers, 1,200 converted factories housing 95,000 workers and various other smaller temporary quarters, according to the Ministry of Manpower. Few temperature checks Since the start of the outbreak, the Singapore government has said it has been advising dormitory operators to monitor workers for fever, encourage personal hygiene and limit mingling in common areas to reduce infection risk. But Nizamul, 27, and other workers who declined to be identified, said that temperature checks were rare at S11 and that a fingerprint scanner was used for entry and exit into the complex just days before the government quarantine. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. Scientists say it spreads through droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, and by people coming in contact with contaminated surfaces before touching their nose, mouth or eyes. Nizamul said before the quarantine he had shared a room with an Indian man who was put on sick leave because of a cold and fever, then tested positive for the coronavirus days later when his health deteriorated. Nizamul said he was moved to a public housing complex and given his own room, and has not tested positive.

Much of the drop into negative territory was chalked up to technical reasons — the May delivery contract is close to expiring so it was seeing less trading volume, which can exacerbate swings. But prices for deliveries even further into the future, which were seeing larger trading volumes, also plunged.  Here's a look at what's happening around the world From The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 4 p.m. ET France on Monday became the fourth country to register more than 20,000 COVID-19 deaths, after Italy, Spain and the United States. The rate of increase in both infections and fatalities also increased, after several days of slowing. ""The epidemic is very deadly and is far from over,"" France's public health chief Jérôme Salomon told a news briefing.  Spain has surpassed the 200,000 mark of coronavirus infections while recording the lowest number of new deaths in four weeks. Health ministry data showed Monday that 399 more people have succumbed to COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the country's total death toll to 20,852. Spain had counted more than 400 daily deaths since March 22. The outbreak's spread has continued at a slower pace than in previous weeks, with 4,266 new infections, which brings the country's total to 200,210. The Spanish government is starting to relax its confinement measures, trying to re-activate the economy after a two-week freeze and allowing children under 12 to venture out to the streets for brief periods from next week.

(Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images) Deaths from the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy rose by 454 on Monday, slightly up from Sunday's tally, while the number of new cases dropped to 2,256, the lowest level in well over a month, the Civil Protection Agency said. Given current trends, Italy's regional health observatory forecast on Monday that two of the country's 20 regions — Basilicata and Umbria — would be registering no new cases by the end of April. By contrast, it would take until the end of June for the worst-hit region, Lombardy, to have zero new coronavirus cases.  Some shops are reopening in much of Germany as Europe's biggest economy takes its first tentative step toward restarting public life after a four-week shutdown. Shops with a surface area of up to 800 square metres are being allowed to reopen on Monday, along with auto showrooms, bike shops and bookshops of any size, under an agreement reached last week between the federal and state governments.

(Andreas Gebert/Reuters) At the same time, when Chancellor Angela Merkel was asked if she backed proposals to help fellow EU countries hardest hit by the pandemic such as Italy and Spain via a bigger European Union budget and the issuance of EU bonds, she said an EU treaty article already allowed such action and that it was used to finance a European short-time work scheme. The German economy is in a severe recession and recovery is unlikely to be quick, as many coronavirus-related restrictions could stay in place for an extended period, the Bundesbank said in a regular monthly economic report on Monday. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that the country would impose a four-day lockdown for 31 cities, starting Thursday. Turkey has imposed such measures over the past two weekends. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Erdogan said the lockdown would be longer this time due to a national holiday that falls on Thursday, adding that weekend lockdowns could continue ""for some time."" Over the weekend, the number of confirmed cases in Turkey exceeded any country outside Europe and the United States. Total cases rose to 90,980 on Monday. Denmark will now test every person with symptoms of the new coronavirus. Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said the country has control of the epidemic, but he said if a person has a dry cough, fever or respiratory problems, they should call the doctor to be tested. The country took another small step toward reopening society when hair salons, dentists, physiotherapists, tattoo parlours and driving schools, among others, were allowed to reopen Monday.  A pedestrian walks past graffiti depicting the logo of Britain's National Health Service, merged with the emblem of the fictional superheroes Superman and Superwoman, on the shuttered entrance of a closed pizza restaurant in Liverpool on Monday. (Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images) Britain needs to be sure that any lifting or easing of physical distancing measures does not lead to a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday. ""The big concern is a second peak, that is what ultimately will do the most damage to health and the most damage to the economy,"" the spokesperson told reporters. ""If you move too quickly then the virus could begin to spread exponentially again. What we need to be certain of is that if we move to lift some of the social distancing measures, it isn't going to lead to the virus starting to spread exponentially again."" Employers in Britain have already put more than a million staff on temporary leave, while finance minister Rishi Sunak said they had received 140,000 applications from firms in the first eight hours their 80 per cent wage subsidy was available on Monday. Russia reported 4,268 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Monday, fewer than the 6,060 on the previous day, which took the total number of cases to 47,121. Forty-four Russian coronavirus patients died in the last 24 hours, the Russian coronavirus crisis response centre said. Like the United States, Russia has seen limited — though passionate — protests against COVID-19 isolation measures. Hundreds gathered in southern Russia on Monday to demonstrate against forced business closures, as they have caused particular pain to households in such regions where salaries are lower and the virus less entrenched.   Why South Korea has managed to flatten the COVID-19 curve   Singapore is reporting a record 1,426 new coronavirus cases, mostly among foreign workers, pushing its total number of confirmed infections above 8,000. The tiny city-state now has the highest number of cases in Southeast Asia, a massive increase from just 200 infections on March 15, when its outbreak appeared to be nearly under control. About 3,000 cases have been reported in just the past three days. Low-wage migrant workers, a vital part of Singapore's workforce, now account for at least 60 per cent of its infections. More than 200,000 workers from poorer Asian countries live in tightly packed dormitories.

India has recorded its biggest single-day spike in coronavirus cases as the government eases one of the world's strictest lockdowns to allow some manufacturing and agricultural activity to resume. An additional 1,553 cases were reported over 24 hours, raising the national total over 17,000. At least 543 people have died from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. The shelter-in-place orders imposed in India on March 24 halted all but essential services. But beginning Monday, limited industry and farming were allowed to resume where employers could meet physical distancing and hygiene norms, and migrant workers can travel within states to factories, farms and other work sites.

72,[],Diamond mines exempt from coronavirus travel restrictions due to economic importance,2020-04-22 11:00,A glaring exception to travel restrictions placed on those entering the Northwest Territories during the COVID-19 pandemic is the one made for workers at the territory’s three diamond mines because of the importance of the mines to the N.W.T economy.,"A glaring exception to travel restrictions placed on those entering the Northwest Territories during the COVID-19 pandemic is the one made for workers at the territory's three diamond mines. At the mines, people from the N.W.T. work alongside those from provinces where there have been far more confirmed cases of the highly contagious respiratory disease. None of the workers from outside the N.W.T. are required to self-isolate for two weeks like most others arriving in the territory. In an email, the territories' chief public health officer said the mines are allowed to continue operating because of the huge role they play in the N.W.T.'s economy. ""The goods produced may be a luxury, but the jobs they provide and impacts on families and communities are very real and important,"" said Dr. Kami Kandola. ""More people die and get sick if they do not have work."" On March 20 the territorial government announced a travel ban into the N.W.T. that excluded mine workers. It was not until April 10 that Kandola introduced requirements aimed at preventing the arrival and spread of COVID-19 at the mines. N.W.T. shuts its borders as 1st case of COVID-19 confirmed in territory The emphasis at the press conference announcing the measures was on how much the mines were already doing to protect their workers, with Dr. Kandola saying, ""It is probably safer to be on those sites than in your own home."" Though the response to the pandemic by the diamond mining companies has been uneven, each one has recognized that, despite prevention measures, there is still a risk of the virus entering the camps. Dominion Diamond Mines has taken the most severe step. On March 19 it suspended production at its Ekati mine. Rio Tinto and De Beers continue to operate their Diavik and Gahcho Kué mines at full production. But on March 20 both companies sent home workers from smaller N.W.T. communities to eliminate the possibility of them bringing the virus from the mines to those communities. Tiny northern communities are believed to be more vulnerable to any COVID-19 outbreaks because of their remoteness and limited health care. There remain about 500 people on site at Diavik and 320 at Gahcho Kué. About half the workers at both mines live in the N.W.T. No cases of COVID-19 have been detected at either mine.  Longer shifts, physical distancing most of the time The chief public health officer required workers at the mines to practice physical distancing for 14 days before each shift — the same thing everyone is required to do at all times. During those 14 days workers are required to record any symptoms and their body temperature each day. (An elevated temperature is an early symptom of the coronavirus.) Rio Tinto says workers at Diavik also have their temperatures taken every day they are at the mine. Workers at Gacho Kué have their temperatures taken before leaving the site, according to De Beers. Workers at the De Beers Gahcho Kue diamond mine are required to wear face masks when being flown and bussed to and from the mine. (De Beers ) Researchers say people who contract the virus will show symptoms within 14 days. The hope is that anyone with the virus will show symptoms during that 14-day period of physical distancing and not bring it to the mines. Shifts have also been lengthened, partly to reduce the number of people coming and going and partly to ensure anyone catching the virus is detected and quarantined before returning home. At both mines those working shifts of two weeks at the mine then two weeks off are now working a month on and a month off, according to De Beers and Rio Tinto. Workers who were on a shift of four days in and three days off are now working two weeks in and two weeks off. Workers are required to wear face masks when being flown and bussed to and from the mines. How non-resident mine workers are monitored for COVID-19 in N.W.T.— and other questions from you In response to a question about what's being done to ensure workers in the second half of their shift are not exposed to workers in the first half of their shift, De Beers said in an email that it is encouraging physical distancing during crew changes, meal times and at daily safety meetings, as well as taking other measures such as extra cleaning. The chief public health officer came up short of requiring mine employees to stay two metres from one another at all times. Her order says that is not required when workers are working or eating meals. Asymptomatic spread The processes set up to catch infections before workers arrive at the mine and once they are there hinges on them showing symptoms. But there is a growing body of evidence that suggests people can contract the virus — and spread it — without showing any symptoms. ""Asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 is occurring,"" noted the federal government last week in a summary of assumptions about the virus.  As N.W.T. prepares for next phase of COVID-19, medical director says physical distancing still key The Reuters news agency reported last week that 60 per cent of the 600 sailors from the U.S. aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt who tested positive for COVID-19 showed no symptoms. The government is leaving it largely up to the mines to ensure they are complying with the order of the chief public health officer. The NWT and Nunavut Workers Safety and Compensation Commission has the authority to perform inspections to ensure compliance but, according to an emailed response, has ""stopped all non-essential travel to the mine sites to ensure the safety and health of our inspectors, workers on the sites, and the general public."" WSCC inspectors will only be sent to the mines if there is ""a serious workplace incident or accident.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/diamond-mines-exempt-from-travel-restrictions-1.5540567

Stay-at-home measures, which experts say are essential to slow the spread of the virus, have ground the economy to a virtual standstill and forced more than 22 million people to apply for unemployment benefits in the past month. In Pennsylvania — where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has promised to veto a Republican-backed bill that would force him to reopen some businesses — a few hundred protesters, most of them in cars, held a demonstration in Harrisburg, the capital. Many of the protesters expressed cynicism toward health experts and skepticism about the actual scale of the pandemic in the country, accusing officials of overreaching and taking actions that had caused more harm than the virus itself. ""All the projections were wrong, but we are still telling people to stay home and businesses to close. This is not quarantine, this is tyranny,"" said Mark Cooper, a 61-year-old retired truck driver. U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican seeking re-election in November, has said state governors should have the final say but has favoured an early end to the lockdowns, and many protesters in the past week have sported pro-Trump signs and campaign gear. Demonstrators protest during a 'Reopen Maryland' rally outside the State House in Annapolis, Maryland. Some of those protesters have said the economic restriction and stay-at-home orders made to combat the COVID-19 pandemic are having worse effects than the disease itself.  (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) Republican lawmakers in several states have also backed the protesters, some of whom have failed to wear face masks or practise the social distancing that health officials say are key to getting the virus under control. ""The Democratic governors are just trying to kill the economy to hurt Trump,"" said Joe Buchert, a 48-year old retired police officer who was wearing a red Trump 2020 hat. Meanwhile in Washington, lawmakers were squabbling over a possible $450 billion US-plus deal to provide more aid to small businesses and hospitals hurt by the crisis. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said a vote could take place on Tuesday. Congress last month passed a $2.3 trillion aid package that included a small-business loan program. The Trump administration wants to add $250 billion to that now-depleted program, while Democrats have pushed for including funding for state and municipal governments and food aid for the poor. Fears of resurgence  Health experts and lawmakers on the front lines of the battle to curb the pandemic have warned that the country could face a second and even deadlier wave of infections if the lockdowns end prematurely. The United States has by far the world's largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 776,000 infections and over 41,000 deaths as of 4:30 p.m. ET. Nearly half of them are in the state of New York, according to a Johns Hopkins tally. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said testing capacity had to be ramped up and that reopening the economy in New York and other parts of the country would need to be calibrated carefully to prevent another surge in cases. ""You don't need protests to convince anyone in this country that we have to get back to work and we have to get the economy going and we have to get out of our homes. Nobody,"" Cuomo told a briefing. ""The question is going to become: how, when, how fast and what do we mean in terms of reopening."" U.S. President Donald Trump attends the daily coronavirus briefing at the White House on April 19, 2020 in Washington, DC. Trump has stated state governors are ultimately in charge of when their economies reopen. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) Earlier, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it could take weeks if not months before the country's most populous city reopens due to a lack of widespread testing, even as officials elsewhere began rolling back restrictions on daily life. ""The federal government is not stepping up,"" de Blasio told a news conference. He said the city needed to be conducting hundreds of thousands of tests a day and to see hospitalizations decline further before the economy reopens. 'Dangerous political game' Trump, who has sparred with a number of Democratic governors critical of his response to the health crisis, has said there were enough tests for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. In a series of tweets on Monday, Trump said governors had shifted from complaining about a scarcity of ventilators to griping about not having what they needed to ramp up testing capacity, while he accused them of ""playing a very dangerous political game."" ""Now they scream 'Testing, Testing, Testing,' again playing a very dangerous political game. States, not the Federal Government, should be doing the Testing - But we will work with the Governors and get it done,"" he said in a tweet. Pro-Trump protesters rally against governors over stay-at-home ordersWe won't let COVID-19 measures strip our freedoms away, says U.S. protester White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said ramping up testing was the top item on the administration's agenda. Trump's guidelines to reopen the economy recommend a state record 14 days of declining case numbers before gradually lifting restrictions. Residents in Florida were allowed to return to some beaches after Gov. Ron DeSantis said some restrictions could be relaxed. Charlie Latham, mayor of Jacksonville Beach, Fla., said the beach there was reopened with limited hours, and it went well with no arrests for people violating social distancing rules which barred chairs and blankets. ""We thought that the public was ready to maintain the social  distancing standards and to exercise good judgment. And it's paid off, it's paid off really well,"" Latham told Fox News. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city reopening is still a long way off, and that the federal government needs to do more when it comes to testing.

A man wearing a mask walks past a mural featuring a health-care worker on Granville Street in Vancouver. (Ben Nelms/CBC) Ottawa has limited ability to ramp up COVID-19 testing nationwide, officials say Federal government officials say Ottawa is doing what it can to help provinces ramp up their COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, but insist their ability to intervene in provinces that fall behind is limited. The federal government and provincial governments have collaborated on testing, but it's ultimately up to the provinces to decide who gets tested and how the data is being collected. Most experts acknowledge that without more widespread testing, it would be difficult for the country to return to normal while avoiding the threat of another major outbreak. Experts warn that provinces that fail to increase testing rates will be faced with a stark choice between delaying the return to normalcy and choosing to ease restrictions while risking a runaway outbreak. A senior federal government official familiar with the issue said the provinces ""get territorial"" when it comes to their jurisdiction over health delivery — and that Ontario is the clear ""laggard"" when it comes to testing. The federal government has been instrumental in procuring testing supplies for the provinces, which have struggled with shortages of key items like swabs and reagents. Health officials say Ottawa can also help assemble the vast number of people needed to do contact tracing. But part of the challenge is that the federal government has no power to set enforceable national standards on who should be tested, or whether the list of testing criteria should now be expanded. Some experts believe Ottawa could at least provide some more forceful guidance on that.  IN BRIEF Trudeau announces $350M support fund for community groups helping vulnerable people Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today announced $350 million in emergency funds for community groups and national charities that help seniors, the homeless and others made more vulnerable by the pandemic. Trudeau said these organizations are struggling to help more and more people due to the global pandemic. The funds will support some small independent groups and national organizations such as the United Way and Red Cross. The money will help the organizations pay for things like volunteer training and transportation. ""Their mission has always been to help people in their time of need and that hasn't changed,"" Trudeau said this morning. ""But COVID-19 is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on those organizations because more people need help."" Read more about the announcement  Ottawa watching food supply chain 'very, very carefully' after Alberta outbreak Meat prices could go up now that a massive processing plant in Alberta has temporarily shut itself down following a COVID-19 outbreak — but it's not likely to lead to a domestic shortage, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said today. The Cargill plant south of Calgary announced Monday it will shut down temporarily after one worker there died and more than 484 people fell ill following a surge in novel coronavirus cases. The High River plant processes about 4,500 head of cattle per day — more than one-third of Canada's beef-processing capacity. Employees at the facility have accused the company of ignoring physical distancing protocols and trying to lure them back to work from self-isolation. The company said in a statement it was a difficult decision to close the facility. Two other meat-packing plants in Alberta have seen workers test positive for COVID-19 and one of those plants is currently experiencing an outbreak. Read more about the outbreak  Can I leave my mask out for a week until the virus dies and then re-use it? CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions, including this one, about the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have one of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: It's better to clean it than leave it out. We know the coronavirus can persist on different surfaces for varying amounts of time, including masks. But when the virus has completely disappeared from a mask is hard to specify, especially if you're not applying any other decontamination measures. ""It will depend on the mask material and conditions where it is sitting,"" said Dr. Anand Kumar, a critical care physician at Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre with a background in infectious diseases. For a virus to go from being present to completely gone is a continuous process, he explains. It decreases over time but it's hard to verify when a mask is virus-free. ""Leaving a mask out for a week will definitely decrease the viral load and the risk of getting infection from the mask. Will it protect you 100 per cent? We don't know,"" said Kumar. If you are using a cloth mask, Health Canada recommends washing it on a hot cycle and drying thoroughly. You can read more of their guidance here. Some hospitals are using autoclaves to sterilize masks, including Kumar and his team. Read more answers to audience questions about COVID-19   THE SCIENCE WHO says 'all available evidence' suggests COVID-19 had animal origin and wasn't produced in lab The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that all available evidence suggests the novel coronavirus originated in animals in China late last year and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory. It was not clear how the virus had jumped the species barrier to humans but there had ""certainly"" been an intermediate animal host, WHO spokesperson Fadela Chaib told a Geneva news briefing. ""It most likely has its ecological reservoir in bats, but how the virus came from bats to humans is still to be seen and discovered."" U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that his government was trying to determine whether the virus emanated from a lab in Wuhan. Chaib did not respond to a request to elaborate on whether it was possible the virus may have inadvertently escaped from a lab. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has dismissed rumours both that it synthesized the virus or allowed it to escape. France said last week there was no evidence so far of a link between the new coronavirus and the work of the P4 research laboratory in Wuhan. France signed an agreement with China in 2004 to establish a research lab on infectious diseases of biosafety level 4, the highest level, in Wuhan. AND FINALLY...

Ambulance Service Station in Vancouver. (Maggie MacPherson/CBC) How South Korea managed to flatten the COVID-19 curve South Korea has an enviable record of handling the outbreak of COVID-19. It has recorded five deaths per million of population, compared to 42 in Canada, 122 in the United States and 437 in Spain. Yesterday, there were just eight new cases reported in South Korea. How did South Korea perform so well? It is a combination of intensive testing and elaborate contact-tracing, said Lee Hoon-sang, a professor of global health security at Yonsei University. In some ways the country experienced a dress rehearsal for this pandemic back in 2015, when it fought an outbreak of MERS, or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome. ""After 2015, there was a massive revamping of the Korean CDC,"" says Lee. ""A new testing method was prepared out of that experience, which was very helpful when COVID-19 came to Korea."" The Korean government partnered with many private bio-medical labs on medical testing, and that public-private partnership quickly generated millions of test kits shortly after China publicized the new virus's genome in January. Over 500 testing facilities were established across the country, starting in February. Many of them are drive-thru, so that Koreans with families can be checked for the virus without having to hire babysitters or bring their children to a hospital. Privacy laws were changed after the MERS outbreak to allow this intrusion only in the case of a national medical emergency. Koreans now receive multiple notifications every day on their cellphones advising them that they may have crossed paths with an infected person at a particular store or restaurant. They are encouraged to seek testing if they experience any symptoms. While citizens in many Western countries would see this as an outrageous infringement of privacy, Yeong-seon Kim, a journalist with the Korean public broadcaster KBS, says the public has accepted it. ""The people understand extraordinary measures are necessary during an extraordinary time. I feel like that, too, and I think the government is doing the right thing right now,"" Kim said.

""The idea is to be proactive, rather than reactive,"" said Opaskwayak Cree Nation Chief Christian Sinclair. There are currently no positive cases of the coronavirus in Manitoba First Nations, but the number of cases on reserve in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec has risen to 52 as of April 19, according to Indigenous Services Canada. One death was also reported in Six Nations of the Grand River in southern Ontario last week. The majority of cases are in Quebec. That's why Serge Simon, the grand chief of the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake, plans on hiring around 30 community members to staff checkpoints into the Mohawk community northwest of Montreal. Communities in Ontario have faced challenges with enforcing pandemic measures. Whitefish River First Nation on Manitoulin Island restricted access to the community as a part of a four-phase pandemic plan that could lead to a total lockdown, but is struggling with getting cottagers and snowbirds who aren't from the community to co-operate. Read more about the situation  Non-medical masks required for air travellers A new rule requiring people flying within the country to have a non-medical mask with them kicked in at noon ET today. According to a news release issued by Transport Canada last week, the new rule requires people to cover their nose and mouth in the following situations: When they are at airport screening checkpoints and the screeners can't keep two metres between themselves and the traveller. When they can't maintain physical distancing from other people or when asked to by an airline employee. When directed to by a public health official or order. Passengers arriving in or departing from Canada will have to prove they have a non-medical mask or face covering with them during the boarding process; if they can't, they can be prevented from continuing their journey. ""If you need to travel, wearing a face covering is an additional measure you can take to protect others around you, especially in situations where physical distancing guidelines cannot be maintained,"" Transport Minister Marc Garneau said in a statement. Read more about the new rule  If I had COVID-19, do I have to throw out my mattress? CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions, including this one, about the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have one of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: The virus is most commonly spread person to person, but we know the coronavirus can persist on different surfaces for varying amounts of time. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch said ""mattresses are no different,"" adding the virus could linger between two hours and two days. Dr. Bogoch suggests mattresses can be disinfected with conventional products approved for use against the coronavirus. You can find Health Canada's recommendations here. To be extra safe, try throwing your sheets in the wash a little more frequently. Read more answers to audience questions about COVID-19   THE SCIENCE COVID-19 likely won't end the handshake, but could it lead to some handshake-free zones? While some doctors would be happy to see the gesture disappear, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it could be extremely challenging to end such a culturally ingrained custom. ""Shaking hands is absolutely one of the leading risk factors for transmitting or acquiring microbial infection such as COVID-19,"" said Paul Pottinger, an infectious disease professor at the University of Washington in Seattle. Micro-organisms that might cause infections can live on the surface of the hand, especially the palm of the hand. When someone shakes hands, those microbes may be transferred from the skin of one person to the skin of the other, Pottinger said. That by itself is usually harmless, but the threat comes when a person who has just received that germ then touches their face and allows those microbes to get into the mouth and nose, or eyes, he said. Pottinger says people can shake hands, but they just have to make sure they clean their hands very carefully afterward. ""Why take the risk? Why not just skip the gesture altogether?"" he asked. Some alternative methods of greeting people have already begun to emerge. Pictures have circulated showing fist bumping as an alternative, not a particularly new way of greeting. Now people have added gestures such as foot shaking or elbow bumping. Others, such as California doctor Mark Sklansky, have suggested the Asian cultural greeting of bowing as an alternative, or the Hindu Namaste hand-clasping greeting, which is popular in southeast Asia. ""My hope is that people recognize that ... even after this pandemic is over, a handshake is a really bad idea,"" said Dr. Sklansky, chief of pediatric cardiology at Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA. AND FINALLY... Coliseum Inn to offer temporary housing to Edmonton's homeless people The 98-room Coliseum Inn, located on Edmonton's Wayne Gretzky Drive, will be used as temporary housing for homeless people. (Avonlea Photography/Facebook) A 98-unit hotel on Wayne Gretzky Drive in Edmonton will become a temporary residence for some of the city's homeless people during the COVID-19 crisis, according to Homeward Trust Edmonton. The Coliseum Inn, located a 10-minute walk from the day drop-in centre set up at the Expo Centre, will be leased and operated by Boyle Street Community Services with support from Homeward Trust and a federal government grant, a news release said. The temporary housing facility begins operations today. After the COVID-19 crisis has subsided, the hotel will be returned to its previous commercial purposes, the news release said. Boyle Street Community Services will manage day-to-day services at the hotel, according to Jordan Reiniger, the organization's executive director. ""This is a great example of our sector coming together and finding a good solution in a bad situation,"" Reiniger said.

77,['The Associated Press'],Coronavirus: Tentative easing of lockdowns underway in some countries,2020-04-20 15:28,"Tattoo parlours and hair salons in Denmark. Beaches in Australia. Bookstores in Germany. Nations around the world took advantage Monday of their flattening coronavirus infection curves to tentatively ease lockdowns, edging toward a new yet unknown state of normal amid a devastating pandemic.","Tattoo parlours and hair salons in Denmark. Beaches in Australia. Bookstores in Germany. Nations around the world took advantage Monday of their flattening coronavirus infection curves to tentatively ease lockdowns, edging toward a new yet unknown state of normal amid a devastating pandemic. China, where the virus started its relentless march around the globe late last year, has already been reopening from a strict lockdown for a few weeks. But the nations testing out the waters Monday were democracies, not a hierarchical communist system, and the sheer variety of choices each made offers plenty of options for U.S. lawmakers and communities to ponder. The game plan is to open up but maintain enough physical distancing to prevent new flare-ups of the virus that has infected 2.4 million people worldwide, killed more than 165,000 and sent the global economy into a tailspin. Easing lockdowns ""is not the end of the epidemic in any country. It's just the beginning of the next phase,"" the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told G20 health ministers in an online meeting. He sternly warned governments not to rush to return to the old normal, saying: ""It is critical that these measures are a phased process.""  Will it really take 'weeks' to ease physical distancing in Canada? Maybe not Why isn't Canada testing everyone for coronavirus? Pro-Trump protesters rally against governors over stay-at-home orders  The debate over easing lockdowns is growing ever more heated in the United States, where President Donald Trump and his administration say parts of the nation are ready to begin a gradual return to normalcy. Yet many governors counter that woefully inadequate federal actions, like a lack of testing supplies, is hindering their response to the pandemic. They say their hard-won successes over the past weeks of battling the virus will be for nought if they reopen their economies too soon and get hit by a second wave of infections. WATCH | Trump doesn't discourage protests to end COVID-19 restrictions: U.S. President Donald Trump didn’t discourage frustrated Americans after more protests to end COVID-19 restrictions were held over the weekend. 2:02 ""We showed that we can control the beast and when you close down, you can actually slow that infection rate, but this is only halftime,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters. ""We still have to make sure that we keep that beast under control, we keep that infection rate down."" The death toll in the U.S., the worst-hit country by far, was more than 41,000 with almost 776,000 confirmed infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University of government reports. The true figures are likely significantly higher since mild infections can be missed, testing is limited and there are plenty of problems in counting the dead amid a crisis. 'Step-by-step process'  Isabel Pennekamp, shopping in the German city of Cologne, was grateful that parts of the country reopened small stores. ""Well, I think it's good, because now people can get out a bit more and normality is a bit more possible again,"" she said. German Health Minister Jens Spahn said the gradual easing ""is a step-by-step process where, after time, we will evaluate what consequences it has had for the infection.""

(Alex Grimm/Getty Images) Cars will again begin rolling off some production lines in Germany, Sweden and Slovakia. In Australia, the production of the country's longest-running soap opera, Neighbours, planned to restart by having separate crews for each key filming site. One city council in Sydney reopened beaches, but stressed they were only for exercise like swimming, running and surfing, and not for sunbathing. ""Living along the coast, I know how important our beaches are to the mental and physical health of so many,"" said Danny Said, mayor of Randwick. Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach remained closed. Tensions in Italy Hair salons, dentists, physiotherapists and even tattoo parlours were allowed to reopen in Denmark but it was not business as usual. Christel Lerche sprayed customers' chairs with alcohol at her salon in suburban Copenhagen and provided hand sanitizer and plastic coat hangers — to be cleaned after each use — to clients keen to get their hair trimmed or styled for the first time since restrictions began on March 11. No magazines were left for customers to share, either. India eased the world's largest lockdown to allow some manufacturing and agricultural activity to resume — if employers can meet physical distancing and hygiene standards. The move came as India recorded its biggest single-day spike in infections.   India's COVID-19 lockdown is among the strictest in the world but has yet to slow the spread   Iran began opening intercity highways and major shopping centres Monday to stimulate its sanctions-choked economy, despite major questions about the country's official virus infection and death toll figures. Slovakia — which has some of the strictest lockdown measures in Europe — plans to reopen small shops, outdoor sports grounds, outdoor market places and restaurants for takeaway meals by Wednesday. They're joining neighbours Austria and the Czech Republic, both of which have already announced they are similarly relaxing restrictions. But not every government was ready to take its foot off the brake just yet. In Italy, tensions have been growing between northern regions, which are pushing to reopen industry despite being hardest hit by the coronavirus, and the south, which fears contagion if the lockdown is eased. Premier Giuseppe Conte is expected to outline what a ""Phase 2"" can look like this week, with the nationwide lockdown set to be lifted on May 4. Still, Gucci on Monday restarted some workshops for leather accessories and footwear, agreeing with unions to provide ""maximum security for workers."" The luxury fashion industry is a major driver of growth in Italy and deadlines are looming to produce fall collections.   The lessons Italy has learned about its COVID-19 outbreak could help the rest of the world   Britain extends coronavirus lockdown at least 3 more weeks   In Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still recovering from a bout of COVID-19 that saw him hospitalized in intensive care, a lockdown imposed March 23 is due to last at least until May 7, and ministers have cautioned that measures are unlikely to be significantly loosened in the short term. Hungary is in a similar situation, with Prime Minister Viktor Orban planning to begin relaxing their lockdown on May 3 or 4. France also is still under a tight lockdown, although starting Monday, authorities allowed families, under strict conditions, to visit relatives in nursing homes once again. In some places, lockdown fatigue was on the rise. Dutch police broke up two illegal gambling events and fined dozens of people for breaching local rules.

(AFP via Getty Images) Governments are caught between keeping their citizens healthy and making sure they still have a roof over their heads or even enough to eat. Worries about the length of lockdowns have a strong basis: the International Monetary Fund expects the global economy to contract three per cent this year. Tens of millions of workers have lost their jobs and millions more fear they'll be next. In Japan, authorities emphasized that the time was not yet right to loosen restrictions by mowing down tens of thousands of tulips in full bloom near Tokyo. The festival celebrating them was cancelled but people still were coming to admire the flowers. ""This situation is now about human life,"" said city official Takahiro Kogo.

With small-business owners reeling during a coronavirus outbreak that has shuttered much economic activity, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was hopeful a deal that could pass Congress quickly and get the Small Business Administration program back up by midweek. ""I think we're very close to a deal today. I'm hopeful that we can get that done,"" he said Sunday. A person wearing a mask uses a sanitization station at a reopened farmers markety in Seattle on Sunday. (Jason Redmond/Reuters) Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said he believed a deal could be reached late Sunday or early Monday. ""We still have a few more details to deal with,"" he said. Under the proposed deal, the government's Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses would get roughly $300  billion US, according to Mnuchin. The program has been swamped by businesses applying for loans and reached its appropriations limit last Thursday after approving nearly 1.7 million loans. That left thousands of small businesses in limbo as they sought help. An additional $50 billion US in the evolving deal would go for disaster loans. About $75 billion would go to U.S. hospitals, those straining under a ballooning coronavirus caseload as well as those struggling to stay financially afloat after suspending elective surgeries during the pandemic. About $25 billion would be added for COVID-19 testing, something states have said was urgently needed. The money for hospitals and testing were priorities sought by congressional Democrats.

There were 507 new deaths, down from a high of more than 700 a day. ""If the data holds and if this trend holds, we are past the high point and all indications at this point are that we are on a descent,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a daily briefing, while urging residents to continue physical distancing. ""We showed you can control the beast. But it's only half time.

The health department's latest daily number is down by 292 from the previous day's 888 deaths. Britain posted a record daily death toll of 980 just over a week ago. Sunday's count is the lowest since April 6 when 439 deaths were reported. However, an industry group estimates thousands of deaths related to COVID-19 in British nursing homes have not been reflected in official figures. The National Care Forum represents non-profit nursing home providers and says its research suggests 4,040 people have died after contracting the illness in British nursing homes. The figures are based on data from nursing and residential care homes looking after 30,000 people, which is 7.4 per cent of Britain's nursing home population. They reported 299 confirmed or suspected deaths from the new coronavirus during the week ending April 13, which is triple the number in the preceding month.

More than 7,000 people believed to have the virus have died in French nursing homes, without family at their sides because of virus protection measures. France banned all nursing home visits early in the pandemic, and many residents have been confined to their rooms for weeks, because the virus has been especially dangerous for the elderly. Several other European countries hard-hit by the virus have imposed similar bans. No more than two family members will be allowed, and they will not be able to touch their elderly loved ones.

Its Facebook page posted a cheerful story encouraging relatives to quiz their aging loved ones about their lives, and photos of smiling third graders at a nearby school making flower arrangements for residents. That quickly changed. By the middle of March, the CEO began sending increasingly alarmed emails about banning visitors, screening staff, confining residents, wiping down all surfaces, and having all-hands-on-deck meetings to prepare everyone for the coming coronavirus ""freight train."" ""I'll be darned if I'm not going to do everything in my power to protect them,"" Donny Tuchman wrote before things got worse. More than 100 staffers, nearly a third of the workforce, went out sick. Those left began wearing garbage bags because of a shortage of protective gear. Not a single resident has been able to get tested for the virus to this day. Now listed with 55 deaths it can only assume were caused by COVID-19, among the most of any such facility in the country, Cobble Hill Health Center has become yet another glaring example of the nation's struggle to control the rapid spread of the coronavirus in nursing homes that care for the most frail and vulnerable. Cobble Hill's grim toll surpasses not only Kirkland's but the 49 deaths at a home outside of Richmond, Va., 48 dead at a veteran's home in Holyoke, Mass., and five other homes in outer boroughs of New York City that have at least 40 deaths each.

Warren/The Associated Press) Out of an Associated Press tally of 8,003 nursing home deaths nationwide, a third of them are in New York state. AP interviews with friends and relatives who have visited the Cobble Hill Health Center in recent weeks, as well as the home's own statements, paint a picture of a facility overwhelmed and unequipped to deal with its coronavirus outbreak, with shortages of staff, personal protective equipment and the availability of reliable testing. ""They were under siege,"" said Daniel Arbeeny, who brought his ailing 88-year-old father from a hospital to the home in late March. ""They were doing the best they could, as far as we could tell at arm's length, under siege."" 'How did we expect this not to spread?' Tuchman told the AP on Sunday that he believes many other homes have more deaths than Cobble Hill but his has been singled out for its honesty. He said it responded to the state's voluntary survey with cases in which it was ""possible"" COVID-19 could be a factor, since his home wasn't able to test any due to the lack of available kits. He also said he reported 50 deaths, not 55, though the state repeated that tally Sunday. ""There's been a lot of lip service about how vulnerable nursing homes have been, and everyone has the best intentions, but it didn't materialize,"" Tuchman said. ""The PPE didn't materialize, the staffing surge didn't materialize, the testing didn't materialize. … How did we expect this not to spread?""  Though Tuchman doesn't know for sure how the virus got into Cobble Hill, he noted there has been a parade of paramedics and staffers allowed into the building each day who were screened with health questions and temperature checks, not enough to keep out those who are sick but not showing symptoms. Soon after news broke of Cobble Hill's death toll, Steven Vince went there to talk to administrators about his recently passed uncle, whose death certificate listed him possibly having COVID-19. An administrator told him they were confident his uncle did not have the virus. Canada's long-term care system needs to change, human rights advocate saysCOVID-19 in Quebec: In mea culpa, Legault says he should have raised wages of long-term care workers long ago ""It's very surprising because I don't think anyone from the facility contacted us to tell us anything like this or basically bring this to our attention in any way,"" he said. Eva Buchmuller, a New York City artist whose best friend has lived in Cobble Hill with Alzheimer's for three years, said she wasn't that surprised the virus spread in the nursing home's cramped quarters, with small rooms tightly packed along narrow corridors and residents not allowed to open windows. She believes it's highly likely her friend is infected. ""How could you avoid not getting the virus?"" she said, noting that the facility is not overcrowded but ""always, always filled up."" Built in a stately brick building that once was a 19th-century hospital, Cobble Hill was most recently rated three out of five stars by the federal government for overall quality and the facility has a complaint rate that's half that of the statewide average for nursing homes.

Earlier this month, Daniel Arbeeny and his family decided to move his elderly father — who was not believed to have COVID-19 — from the Cobble Hill facility to the family's home on a nearby block.

The U.S. on Saturday had more than 700,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 37,086 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The U.S. leads the world in number of deaths and cases. Here's a look at what's happening around the world From The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 9 p.m. ET Italy's commissioner for the coronavirus, Domenico Arcuri, is cautioning against pitting health concerns versus economic worries when deciding to ease lockdown rules, saying, ""without health, the [economic] revival will disappear in the batting of an eyelash."" Health experts say easing must be gradual. Italy has nearly 23,000 deaths, the most in Europe, and more than 172,000 known cases. Authorities in Lombardy and other northern regions, but also Sicily in the south, have been pressing the central government to quickly ease restrictions on factories and many other businesses.

Sanchez says children will be allowed ""to get out of their houses for a period on a daily basis,"" but the specifics need to be ironed out with experts. He says rolling back the national lockdown will only come when the country's embattled health system is ready for possible rebounds. The state of emergency extension until May 9 needs to be approved by parliament. The country on Saturday reached 20,000 deaths — with 565 deaths reported in the last 24 hours — and total infections increased to more than 190,000. Only the United States and Italy have more deaths.

Meanwhile, the country's lower house of parliament approved an emergency budget overnight that takes into account the government's €110-billion ($167-billion Cdn) plan to save the economy from virus-related collapse. The budget includes bonuses for medical staff, funds to help struggling workers and families, and aid to businesses including strategic industries like aviation and car manufacturing.

City officials on Friday attributed the initial undercount to how overwhelmed the health system was coping with thousands of sick patients.  Officials confirmed 20 new cases in a northeastern border province of Heilongjiang — including 13 Chinese nationals who had recently returned from Russia. The province's land border with Russia has been closed. The latest confirmed cases brought the total cases to 82,719, of which 77,029 have recovered and discharged, the National Health Commission said.

On Friday, the Swedish government defended its approach of pursuing relatively liberal policies to fight the coronavirus pandemic, saying it shared the ""same goals"" as other nations fighting COVID-19.

Several of the city's neighbourhoods were put under lockdown, with all people required to stay at home except for essential workers, and only one person per household allowed to buy necessary supplies. Myanmar announced Thursday a ban on gatherings of more than five people. Public health authorities confirmed Saturday six new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total to 94 and five deaths. Myanmar was among the last countries in Southeast Asia to confirm any COVID-19 cases, likely because of lack of testing. The public health infrastructure is considered one of the weakest in Asia.

Protesters in trucks, cars and on motorcycles honked horns on the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and the capital of Brasilia, calling for governors to resign over measures that have forced most businesses to close for weeks. Bolsonaro has been a fierce critic of the states' stay-at-home measures, arguing that the economic harm could be more damaging than the illness. The protests took place a day after Bolsonaro fired his health minister, who had been promoting isolation measures. Brazil has more coronavirus cases than any other country in Latin America. On Saturday, the health ministry said the number of confirmed cases rose by 2,917 to 36,599. Deaths rose by 206 to 2,347, the ministry said.

Japan conducted about 52,000 polymerase chain reaction tests in March, or just 16 per cent of the number carried out in South Korea, according to data from Oxford University. While the measures marked a shift in policy, it remains to be seen how effective they will be, experts say, as Japan struggles with red tape, staff shortages and the absence of centralized decision-making with no single agency co-ordinating the response to the disease. Japan's total infections stand at more than 9,800, with 207 deaths, according to a tally by public broadcaster NHK.

But with casting calls cancelled and studios shuttered, his hopes of stardom are now on hold, as he makes a strategic retreat in the face of insurmountable odds. ""No part-time job, no auditions, there's nothing,"" Houde said. ""I didn't think it was gonna get to the level that it is now."" A 24-year-old actor from Vancouver Island, Houde has starred in shows for kids and teens like Finding Stuff Out and Some Assembly Required. Two years ago he moved to Los Angeles, hoping for his big break. Houde admits it's been difficult — like many who are trying to find their feet in Hollywood, he was counting on a part-time job to make ends meet. But then the coronavirus hit. Days before his first shift at a neighbourhood restaurant, California's governor issued a stay-at-home order. ""I texted my new boss and he's like, 'Yeah, we're closed.' So I'm like, yikes, this is not good. I need to figure something out,"" Houde said. WATCH | Harrison Houde's YouTube compilation of what he did in 2019   Since California issued the order on March 17, thousands of Canadian entertainers who live in the Los Angeles area find themselves in the same boat — one that has now run aground.

With few prospects and no income, Houde says he can no longer afford his rent in Los Angeles. So this week he gathered dozens of sturdy boxes and a roll of tape. ""I'm making the move back to Vancouver because ... there's no work,"" Houde says. ""I might as well move back and try to save some money if I can."" 'I'm a Canadian in America' Many Canadian entertainers in the U.S. are now caught betwixt and between: ineligible for many U.S. unemployment benefits because they're not American citizens, but also ineligible for many Canadian benefits because they're living abroad. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), for instance, is only available for citizens who reside in Canada. And the government says it offers no income support program for Canadians who reside abroad. ""I'm not American. I'm a Canadian in America,"" says R&B singer Sarah Daye. ""I don't have a green card and I'm on a visa, so I'm not eligible."" Singer Sarah Daye worries that the loss of gigs might mean more than the loss of revenue - namely, that her working visa in the U.S. might be in jeopardy, too. (Sarah Daye) The Toronto native has been nominated for a Grammy, fronted the Kevin Eubanks Band (formerly the house band on The Tonight Show) and opened for Lenny Kravitz. But now, her shows are cancelled and she's forced to chase people down for cheques she's owed. ""So I'm kind of at the point where I'm having to be very creative about how am I going to make money,"" Daye says. That includes trying to find platforms ""where they actually pay you"" for performing, and even reaching out to fans for donations. ""You've got to kind of humble yourself and put yourself out there and ask for the support.""

Many, like Daye, are allowed to work in the U.S. thanks to an O-1 non-immigrant visa, which is reserved for those who have demonstrated an ""extraordinary ability or achievement"" in the arts. Musicians worldwide take part in One World: Together at Home concert amid COVID-19 pandemic'It's about making it all happen': How star-studded benefit shows come together during the pandemic However, to maintain their visa status, they have to prove they're working continuously. In February, the Trump administration tightened immigration rules to further restrict entry by those deemed likely of needing social assistance, known as the ""public charge rule.""   Daye says she's already on a visa extension and is scared she might not be able to renew it. ""I'm just really keeping the faith that it's all going to work out,"" Daye says. ""And I'm hoping and praying that there is some support, you know?"" According to one Canadian immigration lawyer in Los Angeles, Canadian artists in the U.S. may be eligible for more support than they realize. Zoe Kevork, managing attorney at Kevork Law and president of Canadians Abroad in Southern California, says there's a lot of confusion about how the shutdown will affect the visa status of Canadians working in the U.S. (Zoe Kevork) Zoe Kevork, managing attorney at Kevork Law and president of Canadians Abroad in Southern California, says she is being bombarded with questions from Canadian clients worried about how they can renew or extend their visas if the projects they're working on are shut down. The answer isn't simple. ""There are varying opinions on at what point are you considered to be out of status or that your visa is no longer valid,"" Kevork says, especially for workers who have been furloughed. ""Is that a material change to your status where now you need to plan for another visa? There is no guidance. It's unclear."" Few supports for artists in U.S. Kevork says Canadian artists on an O-1 visa for extraordinary ability are allowed a 60-day grace period without work. But if they believe they'll be out of work for longer, ""definitely people should be consulting with their immigration lawyers."" But there is some good news. Kevork says Canadian artists in the U.S. need not fear that applying for unemployment insurance will impact their immigration status when it comes to the public charge rule. And those $1,200 stimulus cheques from the Trump administration for coronavirus relief? ""If you've paid your taxes, then you are eligible for it,"" she says. There are few Canadian-based programs for artists living south of the border. Rodney Murphy, who manages all of SOCAN's U.S. activities, believes those who 'have the talent to succeed will find a way to rise above this.' (Jeff Knights/SOCAN) The Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN), for example, says it's helping its 800 or so members who live in the L.A. area. ""I've been in contact with quite a few of them,"" says Rodney Murphy, who manages SOCAN's U.S. activities. ""There definitely is a loss of revenue there."" To help offset those losses, SOCAN created a $2-million Cdn royalty advance program for its members. ""So if someone applies for an advance today [the money] is in their bank within a week,"" Murphy says. David Hope, the executive director of the Actors Fund Canada, says the focus of their programs is helping Canadians in Canada, and that the U.S.-based Actors Fund might be in a better position to help Canadians stateside. (When asked for comment, the Actors Fund did not reply.) The Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA) isn't offering any specific relief for U.S.-based members. In an email, the organization says it's ""been sharing information with our 27,000-plus members,"" and points to its website, which catalogues a list of financial benefits like CERB, most of which are only available to Canadian residents.

Now, she says, life is like a day off — but it's the same day, over and over again. ""Normally, I'm on stage every night and now I'm on my couch every night,"" Percy says. ""I was supposed to be doing a tour of Europe next month and being in Barcelona and Luxembourg and all these amazing places. And now I'm just doing a tour of my house: from the bathroom to the kitchen to the bedroom and back."" Some Canadian entertainers are able to eke out a living during the shutdown by adapting and improvising, something that comes naturally to Percy. She continues to teach standup, but now her class is online instead of in person. ""People don't have to worry about traffic or parking ... or pants even, because they're mostly sitting down,"" Percy says. ""It doesn't even have to be people in L.A. Now I have somebody in South Africa who might be joining my class."" Percy says she tries not to think about how dire her situation is or she'll ""freak out,"" concentrating instead on finding material amid the madness.

""There is humour and comedy out there and there always will be. And I think the darker the situation, the more we need it."" Getting creative 'to rise above this' Despite the challenges facing the Canadian artists he represents, Murphy believes those who ""have the talent to succeed will find a way to rise above this."" ""This experience will help them create great work and great art, and re-wire the creative brain to do new and better things,"" Murphy says. Even though he's in the middle of packing for his move to Vancouver next week, Harrison Houde still finds time to collaborate online with his writing partner Dakota Daulby on their first film.

""It's been kind of therapeutic to some degree,"" Houde says. ""Maybe our writing has improved because we've been locked inside and we just have a lot of time to just think."" Houde is hoping the worst of the pandemic is over by the end of the summer. Then, he says, he'd like to come back, get another apartment in L.A. and pick up where he left off. He's versatile, open to anything. But there's one project he says he wants no part of.

Rhode Island, sandwiched between the hotspots of Massachusetts and New York, has seen a steady daily increase in the number of infections and deaths, with nursing home residents accounting for more than 90 of the state's 118 fatalities. The state's death rate of around 10 people per 100,000 population is among the highest per capita in the nation, according to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project. Massachusetts had its highest number of deaths in a single day on Friday with 159. Republican Gov.

Trump is pushing to relax the U.S. lockdown by May 1, a plan that hinges partly on more testing. Public health officials said the ability to test enough people and trace contacts of those who are infected is crucial before easing up on restrictions, and that infections could surge anew unless people continue to take precautions.

Bolsonaro has been a fierce critic of the states' stay-at-home measures, arguing that the economic harm could be more damaging than the illness. The protests took place a day after Bolsonaro fired his health minister, who had been promoting isolation measures. Brazil has more coronavirus cases than any other country in Latin America.

Japan conducted about 52,000 polymerase chain reaction tests in March, or just 16 per cent of the number carried out in South Korea, according to data from Oxford University. While the measures marked a shift in policy, it remains to be seen how effective they will be, experts say, as Japan struggles with red tape, staff shortages and the absence of centralized decision-making with no single agency co-ordinating the response to the disease. Japan's total infections stand at more than 9,800, with 207 deaths, according to a tally by public broadcaster NHK.

Under the worst-case scenario with no interventions against the virus, Africa could see 3.3 million deaths and 1.2 billion infections, the report by the UN Economic Commission for Africa said. Even with ""intense social distancing"" under the best-case scenario, the continent could see more than 122 million infections, the report said. Any of the scenarios would overwhelm Africa's largely fragile and underfunded health systems, experts have warned. Under the best-case scenario, $44 billion US would be needed for testing, personal protective equipment and treatment, the report said, citing UNECA estimates. The worst-case scenario would cost $446 billion. Most detailed projection yet For most people, the coronavirus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and those with other health problems, it can cause pneumonia and death. As of Friday, the continent had more than 18,000 confirmed virus cases, but experts have said Africa is weeks behind Europe in the pandemic and the rate of increase has looked alarmingly similar. The new report is the most detailed public projection yet for coronavirus infections and deaths in Africa, where more than 1.3 billion people are bracing for the pandemic. Poverty, crowded urban conditions and widespread health problems make Africa ""particularly susceptible"" to the virus, the UN report said. ""Of all the continents, Africa has the highest prevalence of certain underlying conditions, like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS."" On Thursday, a World Health Organization official said one projection over the next six months shows more than 10 million severe cases of the virus. ""But these are still to be fine-tuned,"" said Michel Yao, the WHO's emergency operations manager in Africa, adding that public health measures could have an impact in limiting cases. He did not give the source of the projection. Rapid response urged The new report also warns of severe economic pain across Africa amid the pandemic, with growth contracting 2.6 per cent in the worst-case scenario and an estimated 27 million people pushed into extreme poverty. The World Bank has said sub-Saharan Africa could fall into its first recession in a quarter-century. ""Collapsed businesses may never recover,"" the new report said.

The UN report said the continent has no fiscal space to deal with shocks from the pandemic and recommended a ""complete temporary debt standstill for two years for all African countries, low and middle income included."" The report comes days before African officials launch a new initiative to dramatically accelerate testing for the new virus. More than one million coronavirus tests are being rolled out starting next week to address a major gap in assessing the true number of cases on the continent. It's possible that 15 million tests will be required in Africa over the next three months, the head of the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, told reporters Thursday.

(Charlie Riedel/Associated Press) The official death toll in the U.S. neared 35,000, with about 685,000 confirmed infections. The shutdowns have inflicted heavy damage on economies around the world. In the U.S., the crisis has cost at least 22 million Americans their jobs, pushing the unemployment rate toward levels not seen since the Great Depression. Many Americans, especially in rural areas and other parts of the country that have not seen major outbreaks, have urged governors to reopen their economies. Protesters have taken to the streets in Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia and Michigan, where more than 3,000 turned out on Wednesday in what looked like one of the president's rallies, with Make America Great Again hats and Trump flags.

(Evan Frost/Minnesota Public Radio via AP) Protests continued Friday, including one outside the home of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and another in Idaho, where the governor is a Republican. Public health experts have warned that easing the shutdowns must be accompanied by wider testing and tracing of infected people to keep the virus from coming back with a vengeance. The official death toll in hard-hit New York City soared by more than half earlier this week when health authorities began including people who probably had COVID-19 but died without being tested. Nearly 3,800 deaths were added to the city's count. Here's a look at what's happening around the world From The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 7:30 p.m. ET Russian President Vladimir Putin is prodding federal officials and regional governors to ""act faster and more energetically"" to secure ventilators, protective gear and other essential supplies. He warned Russia is yet to see a peak of infections, adding Moscow was the first to face soaring numbers of infections and ""the problem is spreading into the regions.""

Yuriko Koike. The Japanese capital has seen its new cases shoot up since late March, raising concerns about the infections becoming explosive. Friday's increase in cases comes 10 days after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a month-long state of emergency in Tokyo and six other urban prefectures, a measure he expanded to all of Japan on Thursday.

That would take China's total deaths to over 4,500.  Beijing's pandemic response is China's 'Chornobyl moment,' critics say Wuhan health officials raise death toll linked to COVID-19 by 50%  The revision comes as U.S. and other officials question the accuracy of China's tallies — but also as those countries hit hardest by the pandemic have widely varying methodologies for counting their dead.

Authorities in Germany's 16 states agreed this week to allow a staggered reopening of schools, with students in their final two years of high school and the final year of primary returning first. Germany, a country of 83 million people, has so far recorded almost 137,700 confirmed infections of the novel coronavirus, according to the tally by Johns Hopkins University. Compared to other countries, Germany has had relatively few deaths — 4,052 so far — less than a third the number seen in Britain, which has fewer confirmed cases.

Spain's official gazette published Friday a government order for the country's 17 autonomous regions to unify the criteria on counting the dead in the coronavirus pandemic. The government said that it's following WHO guidance and insists on counting only those who die having tested positive for the virus, whether they show symptoms or not and no matter where the death takes place. That figure on Thursday rose above the 19,000 mark, with a total of more than 182,000 infections. But the accounting system leaves out the patients who died with symptoms but were not tested.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan says wearing face coverings, such as bandanas and scarves, could provide people with another layer of protection against the coronavirus and is lobbying the British government to change its advice. Khan told BBC radio that the evidence he has seen is that wearing a non-medical facial covering ""reduces the chances"" of those who have the virus giving it to somebody else. However, he did concede that it ""doesn't necessarily limit your chances of catching the virus.""  Britain extends coronavirus lockdown at least 3 more weeks  He said changing the advice would be helpful for those in public transport or in shops, where some people may find it difficult to abide by the physical distancing guidelines of staying two metres apart. Khan said it's important that there's a ""consistent approach"" across the country and that's why he's lobbying the government and its advisers. The government's chief medical adviser, Chris Whitty, said Thursday that the evidence around masks being helpful in preventing the spread of the coronavirus is ""weak,"" while conceding it was a ""live issue.""

Here’s a look at how it has changed life in the province in the past month.","From Emerson to Churchill, Falcon Lake to Russell, and everywhere in between, the lives of people in Manitoba have been dramatically affected by the novel coronavirus pandemic. Public health directives, closed schools and daycares and shuttered businesses mean Manitobans are stuck at home. Some are without work or adequate child care. Here's a look at what's happened in Manitoba since the first COVID-19 cases appeared in the province. 1st cases On March 12, the province announced the first three presumptive cases of coronavirus in Manitoba. All three patients — a woman in 40s and two men in their 30s — were exposed to the virus during recent travel. That same day, two screening centres opened in Winnipeg. Other parts of the country had already seen numerous cases by this point, including 59 in Ontario, 17 in Quebec, and 53 in B.C. Saskatchewan also reported its first presumptive case on March 12, and a case involving a child was reported in Calgary. International travel restricted On March 13, the federal government warned Canadians against all international travel and limited inbound flights to stop the spread of COVID-19. Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu called it a ""critical time of containment."" ""Given that there is increased travel happening over the next several weeks, and given that we're at a critical time in keeping our cases down, this is the determination that public health has provided us,"" she said. That same day, the provincial government announced that in-school classes would be cancelled for one week before and after spring break, which was scheduled for the end of March and beginning of April. On March 17, the Canadian and U.S. governments agreed to restrict non-essential travel across the border. Manitoba also announced it was suspending all visits to seniors' homes to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

(Trevor Brine/CBC) On March 18, the province announced it was suspending visitors to acute-care hospitals for the same reason. That same day, federal government announced the first details of its massive aid package to help Canadians and businesses deal with the effects of the pandemic, including an initial promise of $27 billion in direct supports and another $55 billion in tax deferrals. 1st Manitoban hospitalized On March 19, Manitoba public health officials announced a person was hospitalized with COVID-19 — the first person hospitalized with the illness in the province — and was in stable condition. That same day, Chief Provincial Public Health Officer Dr. Brent Roussin announced a 30-bed isolation unit would be created by moving an existing medical unit in the main hospital space at Health Sciences Centre into the former women's hospital area. State of emergency declared March 20 saw some major coronavirus developments in Manitoba. The province declared a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic and banned gatherings of more than 50. It also shuttered wellness centres, including gyms. As announced earlier in the week, daycares and preschools closed at the end of the day, but the province said it would spend $27.6 million on child care for front-line health-care workers. Families Minister Heather Stefanson said licensed child-care centres would continue to get their full operating budgets and the province would establish a grant program to provide money to home-based child-care centres of up to 12 children. In-school classes end Although many parents had already pulled children out of school, on March 23, the province's schools began a three-week closure (which included spring break) to more effectively promote social distancing. In a move to help renters, on March 24, the province froze rent hikes and postponed non-urgent eviction hearings in response to economic challenges caused by the pandemic. Swings are gone from the playground at Gladstone School. The Winnipeg School Division posted signs and removed swings from all 89 of its playgrounds.

That same day, Winnipeg school divisions shut down playgrounds in order to stop the spread of COVID-19 in those areas. Testing expands On March 26, the province expanded its COVID-19 testing to include symptomatic nurses, inmates and homeless people. The federal government also implemented strict mandatory quarantine rules for returning Canadians in an effort to prevent people who might have been exposed to COVID-19 while abroad from passing it on to others. 1st death announced On March 27, public health officials announced Manitoba's first COVID-19-related death.  The woman in her 60s died after she was admitted to an intensive care unit in critical condition the previous week. ""It's a tragic loss. It's a Manitoban that we lost, and our hearts go out to their friends and family,"" Roussin said that morning.   ""But this is our time to act now. Stay home if you can.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the wage subsidies would be backdated to March 15, 2020. He also said the government would provide bank loans of up to $40,000 for small businesses, which would be interest-free for the first year. ""We're helping companies keep people on the payroll so that workers are supported and the economy is positioned to recover from this. That is our priority,"" Trudeau said. City shuts down playgrounds On March 27, the province announced that as of March 30, public gatherings would be limited to 10 people, down from 50. The City of Winnipeg said that as of March 28, all of its play structures, including picnic structures, would be closed in order to comply with the provincial health order. Also on March 28, the prime minister announced people showing symptoms of COVID-19 would no longer be able to travel domestically by plane or train.  At a news conference on March 29, Trudeau pledged help for children and seniors struggling with accessing essential services while stuck at home. The federal government pledged $7.5 million in funding to Kids Help Phone to provide mental health support to children and youth impacted by school closures and reduced access to social support and community resources. The federal government said it would also spend $9 million through United Way Canada to help the country's older population get groceries, medication and other critical items. Gathering limit now 10 Effective March 30, gatherings were limited to 10 people in Manitoba. The province also announced it would restrict the operations of non-essential businesses under a new public health order.

""We knew to expect this. As more and more cases are introduced into a jurisdiction, community transmission is going to be inevitable."" Most cases on 1 day On April 2, the province announced 40 newly identified cases of COVID-19. As of April 29, that remains the highest number of new cases Manitoba has seen in a single day. As of April 2, 167 people were suspected or confirmed to have the coronavirus. Businesses around Winnipeg were already closing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the province ordered the closure of gyms on March 20. (Tyson Koschik/CBC) 2nd and 3rd deaths On April 3, public health officials announced a Winnipeg man in his 50s was confirmed as the second COVID-19-related fatality in Manitoba. The man had underlying health conditions and had been admitted to an intensive care unit before he died, Roussin said that day. ""These are challenging times for us all. We're seeing our case numbers continually grow. We are seeing severe outcomes, which is quite distressing to many Manitobans,"" he said. ""But again, this is not the time for fear. This is the time for our actions."" The third death was announced four days later on April 7. Roussin said it was a Winnipeg man in his 60s who had underlying medical conditions. Fines for order-breakers On April 9, Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman joined Pallister to announce people and businesses in Manitoba could be handed set fines for breaking the province's public health orders. Breaking those rules — which banned public and outdoor gatherings of more than 10 people, forced non-essential businesses to close and required people in stores stay two metres away from each other — could cost $486 for individuals and $2,542 for businesses. St. Boniface is among the Winnipeg hospitals where workers fell ill. (Trevor Brine/CBC) ""Sadly, there is a small minority of people who are not doing their part,"" Pallister said. ""At the end of the day, it is apparent that enforcement is needed as well."" 4th and 5th deaths On April 10, Roussin announced a man in his 70s, who had been in intensive care with underlying conditions, was the fourth person with COVID-19 to die. Before the man was hospitalized he was at a personal care home, Roussin said, but it's not believed the man contracted the coronavirus while he was there. On April 15, health officials announced a woman in her 60s from southwestern Manitoba had died after testing positive for the virus.  This was the first death connected with the illness in Manitoba outside Winnipeg. The woman was hospitalized in the Prairie Mountain Health Region, but not in intensive care when she died, Roussin said.

They also restricted travel north of the 53rd parallel and into remote communities with no summer road access. More recoveries than active cases April 17 was a momentous day for Manitobans because it marked the first time in the course of the pandemic that more people had recovered from COVID-19 than were actively experiencing symptoms.

(Trevor Brine/CBC) ""This is thanks to the efforts of Manitobans … staying home [and] practising social distancing.

He added he's ""cautiously optimistic."" 6th death On April 20, the province announced a Winnipeg woman in her 80s who had COVID-19 had died. ""We're extending our condolences to her family and friends,"" Roussin said. That same day, the Premier announced he was extending the province's state of emergency until May 18. On April 28, COVID-19 testing was opened to anyone showing symptoms, including mild ones. To meet the expected increase in demand under the new testing criteria, the province announced Ontario-based Dynacare would do some testing, in addition to the province's Cadham Provincial Lab. Plan to reopen economy released On April 29, Pallister announced some of the public health restrictions would be lifted. He said as of May 4, a number of non-essential health-care and retail businesses will have the option of reopening under strict guidelines. That opens the door to several services, businesses and venues, including:  Non-urgent surgery and diagnostic procedures. Therapeutic and medical services. Retail businesses. Restaurants (patio and walk-up services only — dining rooms must remain closed). Hair salons. Museums, galleries and libraries. Seasonal day camps. Outdoor recreation and campgrounds.

The Republican president targeted three swing states critical to his re-election bid — Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia — where his conservative loyalists have mounted pressure campaigns challenging those governors' stay-at-home orders. Amplifying a theme that his supporters have trumpeted this week in street protests at the state capitals of Lansing, St. Paul, and Richmond, Trump issued a series of matching Twitter posts touting the slogans: ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"" ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA!"" and ""LIBERATE VIRGINIA!"" At a news conference on Friday, Trump again criticized the handling of some states' coronavirus mitigation measures as Virginia ""too tough."" Asked if certain states — Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia — should lift their stay-at-home orders, Trump said: ""No, but I think elements of what they've done are too much.""

(Evan Frost/Minnesota Public Radio via AP) Michigan has become a particular focus of agitation to relax physical-distancing rules that rank among the strictest in the nation after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, widely seen as a potential running mate for presumed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, extended them through the end of April. Protesters defying the restrictions from the steps of the state Capitol on Wednesday shouted ""lock her up,"" a chant that was a staple of Trump's campaign rallies and originally referred to his 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. In battle with governors over reopening, Trump backs downWe won't let COVID-19 measures strip our freedoms away, says U.S. protester Whitmer said on Friday she was hopeful her state, which suffered one of the country's fastest-growing coronavirus infection rates, can begin to restart parts of its economy on May 1. But she urged doing so cautiously to avoid reigniting the outbreak just as it appeared to be getting under control. Responding to Trump's critique later in the day, she said, ""We will re-engage our economy when it's safe,"" adding: ""The last thing I want to do is to have a second wave here."" 'Passing the buck' Trump also took renewed aim at one of his favourite political foils, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in a tweet suggesting that his state, the U.S. epicentre of the outbreak, had asked for too much assistance that was never fully used. At his televised daily news briefing, Cuomo shot back saying Trump should ""maybe get up and go to work"" instead of watching TV, and accused the president of favouring the airline industry and business cronies in a recent bailout package that left little for the states. Cuomo said Friday that he needed federal help to ramp up testing for the coronavirus and to reopen his economy, and criticized the White House, accusing Trump of bailing on a comprehensive testing strategy because it was 'too complicated."" WATCH | Cuomo criticizes Trump over lack of federal aid: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says U.S. states can't reopen their economies until coronavirus testing is ramped up and more funding comes from Washington. 2:30 He said he needs federal funding to significantly ramp up testing capacity and to fill a $10 to $15 billion US budget shortfall that is hampering the state's ability to fund such efforts on its own. He criticized the aid packages passed by Congress to date for a lack of funds to hard-hit states like New York. ""Is there any funding so I can do these things that you want us to do? No,"" Cuomo told a daily briefing. ""That is passing the buck without passing the bucks."" Reopening U.S. Trump, who played down the coronavirus threat in the early stages, had pressed earlier to restart idled businesses as soon as May 1, declaring ""total"" authority to do so while branding governors who resisted his approach as ""mutineers."" In the end he acknowledged it was up to the governors to decide when and how to relax the stay-at-home orders they themselves had imposed since last month, presenting his guidelines as recommendations. On Thursday, Trump unveiled new federal guidelines for a staggered, three-stage process by which states could gradually lift restrictions on businesses and social life as the pandemic ebbed.

Few global leaders have done more than Bolsonaro to play down the pandemic, which has killed nearly 2,000 Brazilians. He has called the virus ""a little flu"" and criticized state governors for imposing restrictions supported by health experts and the popular outgoing minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta. In televised remarks met with pot-banging protests in several major cities, Bolsonaro said Mandetta did not fully appreciate the need to protect jobs and he called again for a resumption of business in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy. ""We need to return to normal, not as fast as possible, but we need to start having some flexibility,"" Bolsonaro said. The government cannot afford to provide emergency aid to the poor for much longer, he said. The dispute at the highest reaches of Brazilian politics coincides with several countries debating when and how life should start returning to normal after coronavirus lockdowns, which are predicted to drive the global economy into recession. Backlash grows against Brazil's Bolsonaro even as he moderates tone on pandemicExperts study how coronavirus pandemic affects trust in officials, ourselves Medical experts agree that a peak in Brazil is still weeks away and it is too early to end physical distancing. ""Do not think we are past a peak in growth of the virus. The health system is still not prepared for an acceleration,"" Mandetta warned in his parting comments at the ministry. Bolsonaro polling poorly on pandemic response While Bolsonaro sharply criticized the shutdowns, the Health Ministry under Mandetta provided guidance supportive of the physical distancing measures. Mandetta's daily briefings had also contradicted Bolsonaro's praise for unproven drugs. Incoming minister Nelson Teich, asked at a news conference about the ministry's position now that he was in charge, said there will not be any ""sudden changes"" in policy. However, he added: ""There is a complete alignment between me and the president."" Brazilians carry food donated by a cultural centre during the coronavirus pandemic in the Turano favela of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Wednesday.   (Silvia Izquierdo/The Associated Press) Teich, who founded an oncology group, lacks the political experience of his predecessor, a former lawmaker who had begun to upstage Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro's popularity has slid and he faces nightly protests from Brazilians banging pots from their windows over his handling of the outbreak. In addition to the daily 8:30 p.m. protest on Thursday, people also spontaneously began striking cookware when Bolsonaro announced Mandetta's firing. The Health Ministry's response to the epidemic was rated ""good"" or ""great"" by 76 per cent of Brazilians surveyed by pollster Datafolha. Just 33 per cent of those surveyed gave Bolsonaro the same ratings.

Wendy Paquette, her daughter, said not knowing the answer is preventing her from sleeping. ""Where is our mom? Is she in a refrigerated truck? A crematorium?"" she said. ""It's nightmarish.

The LaSalle Hospital residence is one of the CHSLDs (centres d'hébergement de soins de longue durée) in Quebec listed as being in a critical situation, with more than 50 per cent of its residents having tested positive for COVID-19. Guillaume Bérubé, a spokesperson for the health agency for the region, confirmed refrigerated trucks have been installed outside the LaSalle, Douglas and Lakeshore hospitals, but would not confirm whether the trucks are being used to store bodies now. Bérubé said the normal procedure is to inform the family immediately following a death and to ask if they have a contract with a funeral home before the body is moved to the morgue. Either the hospital administration or the funeral home then calls the family to make further arrangements. However, Paquette said when staff called to inform them of their mother's death, they were told Health Canada would be the one issuing the death certificate and that the family would be contacted.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry made the announcement this morning, after the release of detailed statistical information showing B.C. has so far succeeded in reducing the number of cases and avoided overwhelming the health-care system. Examples of activities that could return in a few weeks include elective surgeries, as well as changes that would help reactivate sectors of the economy. However, Henry cautioned that significant restrictions would still be in place for some time — likely until a vaccine has been developed for the virus — and that B.C.'s continued success in avoiding a large outbreak would rely on public health measures rather than developing herd immunity. Health officers also are concerned about a second wave of the virus returning in the fall, and have begun ordering more ventilators and adding to the number of acute care spaces in the province's hospitals as a precautionary measure. Read more about the situation in B.C.  Trudeau announces billions in aid for energy, rural business and arts sectors Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced $1.7 billion to clean up orphan wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, as well as aid for rural businesses and people working in the arts and culture sectors. The aid to clean up orphan and abandoned wells is expected to help maintain 5,200 jobs in Alberta alone — earning praise from Premier Jason Kenney. Trudeau also announced that Ottawa will establish a $750-million emissions reduction fund, with a focus on methane, to create jobs through efforts to cut pollution. The fund includes $75 million to help the offshore industry cut emissions in Newfoundland and Labrador. Here are some of the other areas that will receive aid from the federal government:  $962 million for regional development agencies to help smaller employers in rural areas that do not have access to traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions. $270 million for a program for entrepreneurial and industrial research. $500 million to support Canadians who work in the arts, culture and sports sectors.

CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions, including this one, about the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have one of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: ""Although self-checkout allows you to distance from others, it also requires touching more surfaces,"" said Siyun Wang, associate professor of food safety engineering at the University of British Columbia's faculty of land and food systems. But Wang said the risk of infection at the grocery store is low, if you ""go where there are fewer people and shop efficiently, because person-to-person contact is the No. 1 concern."" She also said it's good to minimize the amount of time you spend in the store and to use a touchless payment method. ""In both cases, consumers should be wiping their hands with a disinfectant wipe before they leave the store at the exit, and then again when they come home, and again after they put the groceries away when they get home,"" said Jeffrey Farber, director of the Canadian Research Institute for Food Safety and a professor at the University of Guelph. He also said everyone should wash their hands before they eat. Read more answers to audience questions about COVID-19   THE SCIENCE Return to normal hinges on immunity, say those pushing for new COVID-19 blood tests The push to start measuring COVID-19 immunity is gaining steam, with several provinces hinting at plans to roll out blood tests that could pave the way for a return to some semblance of normal everyday life. Serology tests measure the antibodies that appear in the blood after someone has battled an infection — including those who don't even know they had COVID-19 because they didn't meet testing criteria, didn't seek care or had mild or no symptoms. This data is important for policy makers deciding when to ease restrictions, said epidemiologist Patrick Saunders-Hastings, director of life sciences and environmental health at Gevity Consulting Inc. Without it, our picture of COVID-19's spread in Canada remains incomplete — diagnostic laboratory tests now in use largely focus on high-risk groups and only capture people actively infected with the virus. ""That's where serological testing comes in,"" said Saunders-Hastings. ""We just can't — won't — get those counts from the traditional laboratory testing."" Another big question it could help address is: When can physical distancing measures be lifted? Simply put, a return to normal is contingent on finding as many active and resolved COVID-19 cases as possible. Those who are immune can help those who are vulnerable because they won't unknowingly spread the virus, said Saunders-Hastings. AND FINALLY... A 'beacon of hope' along a Nova Scotia highway A massive, glowing heart built as a tribute to front-line workers can be spotted just past the on-ramp from Hammonds Plains Road overlooking the northbound lanes of Highway 102 in Bedford, N.S. (Submitted by Ed McHugh) Perched atop a rocky cliff on the edge of a busy highway just outside Halifax is a massive glowing red heart. It was placed there by a group of Bedford, N.S., residents as a tribute to front-line workers and a symbol of community during the COVID-19 pandemic. The location of the heart may be familiar to locals as the home of Charlie, an underwhelming and endearingly unremarkable roadside Christmas tree that has delighted commuters every holiday season for the past 20 years. Ed McHugh, whose family decorates the tree on the edge of his property, recently teamed up with a few friends to give Charlie a cliffmate — including Ross Lloy, who built the heart using wood and red Christmas tube lights. They dubbed the heart Valery, a name that has Latin origins meaning brave, strong and health. ""People need some good news. I'm not trying to trivialize ... how serious the situation is at all, but people need to see signs that other people care,"" said McHugh, whose wife, Shelly, is a nurse who came out of retirement to help during the pandemic.

Trump said the U.S. will continue to engage with the WHO in pursuit of ""meaningful reforms."" ""We're doing a very thorough investigation as we speak,"" he told reporters, saying it would take about 60 to 90 days. ""[The WHO] is very China-centric,"" he said, adding, it's ""not right.""   Scheer, Conservatives raise concerns about WHO data, relationship with China  The United States contributed nearly $900 million US to the WHO's budget for 2018-19, according to information on the agency's website.

The U.S. gave nearly three-fourths of the funds in ""specified voluntary contributions"" and the rest in ""assessed"" funding as part of Washington's commitment to UN institutions. A more detailed WHO budget document provided by the U.S. mission in Geneva showed that in 2019, the U.S. provided $452 million, including nearly $119 million in assessed funding. In its most recent budget proposal from February, the Trump administration called for slashing the U.S. assessed funding contribution to the WHO to $57.9 million.

Front-line doctors want everyone coming into the hospital to get a test, while nursing homes can only test people with symptoms. Ontario has a backlog of tests one day and an excess capacity the next. How did this happen?","When did Canada's coronavirus testing go off the rails? The first clues were evident back on Jan. 24, the day after Wuhan, China, was locked down. ""We're ready; we're prepared."" Those were the confident words from Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, in a news briefing that day. The province already had a ""specific and reliable"" coronavirus test that could deliver results in 24 hours. The public message was clear. We've got this. After all, Ontario had survived SARS. ""Folks, it will still be business as normal,"" said Peter Donnelly, head of Public Health Ontario, at the same briefing.  One of the testing machines at the Public Ontario Health lab that has been running at full capacity to test COVID-19 patient samples.  (Craig Chivers/CBC) Through the unforgiving lens of hindsight, they could not have been more wrong. It's now brutally clear that SARS was just a warm-up — that roughly as many Canadians would die in just the first few weeks of this pandemic than in the entire SARS outbreak. And a critical weapon in the battle, laboratory testing, became log-jammed in the opening days. Backlogs quickly mounted One week after the province closed schools and shops and prohibited large gatherings, many labs were overwhelmed. By the first weekend, Ontario had a backlog of more than 7,200 tests. B.C. also reported a backlog, as did Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba. Almost immediately, provinces began restricting who could be tested — limiting it to front-line health-care workers, people with severe symptoms and those who work with vulnerable groups. Over the past week, the backlogs have cleared, but restrictions on testing still remain in most parts of Canada. Laboratory personnel at Ontario's public health laboratory have been working long hours for weeks trying to keep up with the demand for COVID-19 testing.  (Craig Chivers/CBC) And the hard truth is that testing will continue to be limited, even in Ontario, which has just announced it will soon be able to test 19,000 people a day. ""Even when we're at 19,000 tests a day, we're not going to be able to test everybody, and that would be the same in every other jurisdiction,"" said Vanessa Allen, chief of medical microbiology at Public Health Ontario, the government agency responsible for provincial labs. Ontario solves problem, creates another Just as the backlog was cleared, a new and equally frustrating problem emerged. Media reports on Tuesday revealed that Ontario's testing rate was dropping to just over 2,500 per day, but the province said it could run about 13,000. Why isn't Ontario testing more? The province created a new network of clinical labs in the middle of the pandemic — like building a bigger boat, mid-ocean, in a hurricane. The Ministry of Health had the accounting firm KPMG organize all the labs in the province that are capable of microbial testing. That includes 10 hospital networks, six public health labs and three private lab networks. Added up, they can do 13,000 tests per day, and expect to reach 19,000 in three weeks. But that extra capacity was created suddenly, which means there weren't enough patient samples waiting to be tested, because there are still testing restrictions in place. An expert committee is working on new recommendations on who should be tested and Premier Doug Ford is calling for expanded testing in long-term care homes and for other vulnerable populations. Meanwhile, frightened patients such as Nick Marceau of Toronto can't get tested, even though his doctor suspects he has COVID-19. Dr. Kevin Katz is the medical director for laboratory testing in six Toronto hospitals. Katz began stockpiling COVID-19 testing supplies in early February, preparing for the worst.  (North York General Hospital) ""It's frustrating to … somebody who lives alone when when you're confronted with this,"" Marceau, 38, said. Marceau doesn't qualify for a test because he hasn't travelled, isn't in a high-risk group and his symptoms aren't severe enough to send him to hospital. ""It was judged that it was a watch-and-wait situation,"" he said.  'Completely unparalleled' Why is testing such a big problem? The simple answer — the COVID-19 tsunami caught almost everybody off guard. ""Everybody in the world is ramping up for the same tests, and they're all vying for the same reagents,"" said Allen, referring to the chemicals necessary to perform the tests.

Front-line doctors want everyone coming into the hospital to get a test, while nursing homes can only test people with symptoms. Ontario has a backlog of tests one day and an excess capacity the next. How did this happen?","When did Canada's coronavirus testing go off the rails? The first clues were evident back on Jan. 24, the day after Wuhan, China, was locked down. ""We're ready; we're prepared."" Those were the confident words from Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, in a news briefing that day. The province already had a ""specific and reliable"" coronavirus test that could deliver results in 24 hours. The public message was clear. We've got this. After all, Ontario had survived SARS. ""Folks, it will still be business as normal,"" said Peter Donnelly, head of Public Health Ontario, at the same briefing.  One of the testing machines at the Public Ontario Health lab that has been running at full capacity to test COVID-19 patient samples.  (Craig Chivers/CBC) Through the unforgiving lens of hindsight, they could not have been more wrong. It's now brutally clear that SARS was just a warm-up — that roughly as many Canadians would die in just the first few weeks of this pandemic than in the entire SARS outbreak. And a critical weapon in the battle, laboratory testing, became log-jammed in the opening days. Backlogs quickly mounted One week after the province closed schools and shops and prohibited large gatherings, many labs were overwhelmed. By the first weekend, Ontario had a backlog of more than 7,200 tests. B.C. also reported a backlog, as did Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba. Almost immediately, provinces began restricting who could be tested — limiting it to front-line health-care workers, people with severe symptoms and those who work with vulnerable groups. Over the past week, the backlogs have cleared, but restrictions on testing still remain in most parts of Canada. Laboratory personnel at Ontario's public health laboratory have been working long hours for weeks trying to keep up with the demand for COVID-19 testing.  (Craig Chivers/CBC) And the hard truth is that testing will continue to be limited, even in Ontario, which has just announced it will soon be able to test 19,000 people a day. ""Even when we're at 19,000 tests a day, we're not going to be able to test everybody, and that would be the same in every other jurisdiction,"" said Vanessa Allen, chief of medical microbiology at Public Health Ontario, the government agency responsible for provincial labs. Ontario solves problem, creates another Just as the backlog was cleared, a new and equally frustrating problem emerged. Media reports on Tuesday revealed that Ontario's testing rate was dropping to just over 2,500 per day, but the province said it could run about 13,000. Why isn't Ontario testing more? The province created a new network of clinical labs in the middle of the pandemic — like building a bigger boat, mid-ocean, in a hurricane. The Ministry of Health had the accounting firm KPMG organize all the labs in the province that are capable of microbial testing. That includes 10 hospital networks, six public health labs and three private lab networks. Added up, they can do 13,000 tests per day, and expect to reach 19,000 in three weeks. But that extra capacity was created suddenly, which means there weren't enough patient samples waiting to be tested, because there are still testing restrictions in place. An expert committee is working on new recommendations on who should be tested and Premier Doug Ford is calling for expanded testing in long-term care homes and for other vulnerable populations. Meanwhile, frightened patients such as Nick Marceau of Toronto can't get tested, even though his doctor suspects he has COVID-19. Dr. Kevin Katz is the medical director for laboratory testing in six Toronto hospitals. Katz began stockpiling COVID-19 testing supplies in early February, preparing for the worst.  (North York General Hospital) ""It's frustrating to … somebody who lives alone when when you're confronted with this,"" Marceau, 38, said. Marceau doesn't qualify for a test because he hasn't travelled, isn't in a high-risk group and his symptoms aren't severe enough to send him to hospital. ""It was judged that it was a watch-and-wait situation,"" he said.  'Completely unparalleled' Why is testing such a big problem? The simple answer — the COVID-19 tsunami caught almost everybody off guard. ""Everybody in the world is ramping up for the same tests, and they're all vying for the same reagents,"" said Allen, referring to the chemicals necessary to perform the tests. ""This is not an Ontario issue; this is an international issue. ""The demand for this test is completely unparalleled.""

99,['The Associated Press'],China's economy in worst downturn since '70s amid coronavirus battle,2020-04-17 12:50,China faces a drawn-out struggle to revive its economy after it suffered its biggest contraction since at least the 1970s after ordering hundreds of millions of people to stay home to fight the coronavirus.,"China faces a drawn-out struggle to revive its economy after it suffered its biggest contraction since at least the 1970s after ordering hundreds of millions of people to stay home to fight the coronavirus. The world's second-largest economy shrank by 6.8 per cent from a year earlier in the quarter ending in March after factories, offices and shopping malls were closed to contain the outbreak, official data showed Friday. Consumer spending, which supplied 80 per cent of last year's growth, and factory activity were weaker than expected. China, where the pandemic began in December, is the first major economy to start to recover after the ruling Communist Party declared the virus under control last month. It has allowed factories to reopen but cinemas and other businesses that employ millions of workers still are closed. 'V-shaped' recovery seen as unlikely There are signs that after an ""initial bounce"" as controls ended, ""the recovery in activity has since slowed to a crawl,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. ""China is in for a drawn-out recovery."" Forecasters earlier said China might rebound as early as this month. But they say a sharp, ""V-shaped"" recovery looks increasingly unlikely as negative export, retail sales and other data pile up. Instead, they expect a gradual crawl back to growth in low single digits in the coming quarters. For the full year, forecasters including UBS, Nomura and Oxford Economics expect little to no growth. Retail sales fell 19 per cent from a year earlier in the first quarter. That improved in March, the final month of the quarter, to a decline of 15.8 per cent. But consumers, jittery about possible job losses, are reluctant to spend despite government efforts to lure them back to shopping malls and auto showrooms. That is a blow to automakers and other companies that hope China will power the world economy out of its most painful slump since the 1930s. Labourers wear face masks to protect against the spread of the novel coronavirus as they look at job postings at a market in Qingdao, in eastern China's Shandong province, on April 8. (Chinatopix/The Associated Press) Job-hunter Ni Hong's challenge highlights the problem. Ni, 32, quit her job in Beijing in January to find a new one, but the virus disrupted those plans. Ni is paying her mortgage out of her savings and avoiding other spending while she looks in a market flooded with newly laid-off workers. ""In the past, there were maybe two or three candidates for a post,"" Ni said. ""Now, I have eight to 10 competitors, so the chance for me to be eliminated is much higher."" China's leaders base their claim to power on their ability to deliver economic success. The ruling party has appealed to companies to keep paying employees and avoid layoffs. But an unknown number have failed, adding to the public's anxiety. WATCH | World Bank says multilateral banks offering $240 billion US to help poorer countries with economic shock of COVID-19 'We are responding forcefully and massively' to the crisis, says World Bank president David Malpass, as the most basic issues emerge. 1:20 Economy already squeezed by tariff war The economy already was squeezed by a tariff war with U.S. President Donald Trump over Beijing's technology ambitions and trade surplus. Last year's growth sank to a multi-decade low of 6.1 per cent. Exports were down 6.6 per cent in March from a year earlier, an improvement over the double-digit plunge in January and February. But forecasters say demand is bound to slump in America and Europe as anti-virus controls keep shoppers at home. ""Lingering consumption weakness and sliding foreign demand will weigh on the upturn,"" Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said in a report. COVID-19 has world's major economies on track for worst quarterly decline in historyGlobal economy will suffer worst year since Great Depression of 1930s, IMF says Growth was stronger than some forecasts that called for a contraction of up to 16 per cent, but this is the biggest contraction since market-style reforms started in 1979. ""The numbers were even uglier than most anticipated, which is good!"" Andy Rothman of Matthews Asia said in a report. ""These ugly numbers indicate that the leadership didn't fudge the data to hide the seriousness of the situation."" Investment in factories, real estate and other fixed assets, the other major growth driver, sank 16.1 per cent. Auto sales sank 48.4 per cent from a year earlier in March. That was better than February's record 81.7 per cent plunge but is on top of a two-year-old decline that is squeezing global and Chinese automakers in the industry's biggest global market.
