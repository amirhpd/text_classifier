A total of 59 cases of unknown viral pneumonia have been reported in the city of Wuhan, central China, with seven patients in critical condition, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement on Sunday. All patients are being treated in quarantine, and no deaths have been reported. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), symptoms of the pneumonia are mainly fever, with a number of patients having difficulty breathing, and chest radiographs showing invasive lesions of both lungs. The outbreak came to light in late December and prompted fears in China of a possible resurgence of SARS, an acute viral respiratory illness first reported in the country in 2002 that caused a pandemic that ripped through Asia. SARS spread to 37 countries worldwide , infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 from November 2002 to July 2003. The illness is brought on by a coronavirus, and symptoms include fever, cough, severe headache, dizziness and other flu-like complaints. Read More Amid growing disquiet, Wuhan authorities said on Sunday they had excluded the possibility of SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and bird flu. Women wear facemasks as the city's commuters protect themselves against the H7N9 bird flu virus in the downtown area of Shanghai in 2013. If not SARS, then what is it? According to the Wuhan health commission, the infection broke out between December 12 and December 29, with some of the patients employed at a seafood market in the city. Local media reported that the market -- which has been closed since January 1 for disinfection -- also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes, sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals. Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it is highly likely that the outbreak was caused by a ""brand-new viral pneumonia."" ""The concern now is whether the game (sold at the market) is one of the reasons for the outbreak,"" he told CNN. According to Hui, many new pathogens have been transmitted to humans from animals. The coronavirus that causes SARS was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of southern China, where the epidemic first broke out. And dromedary camels are considered a likely source of MERS, he said. Authorities have said that there has been no obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission so far, and no health care workers have been infected. At least 163 people who have had close contact with those infected have been placed under medical observation. But there are still fears of a nationwide epidemic. The outbreak came just before the start of the busy Lunar New Year travel season, when hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to be crammed into trains, buses and planes for family reunions. Millions of Chinese are also expected to travel overseas around Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25. Professor Leo Poon, a virologist at Hong Kong University and a SARS expert, said the severity of the situation to come depends on whether the pneumonia in Wuhan can be transmitted among humans. ""If it only transmits from animals to humans, now that the market has been shut down and sanitized, the chances for people to be infected will be low,"" he said. Hui, from Chinese University, said the possibility of human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out. ""Most often, respiratory viruses can be transmitted among humans. It is only a matter of how contagious it is,"" he said. Passengers get their temperature checked in 2015 as part of preventive measures against the spread of MERS at Hong Kong airport. Asia steps up screening The current outbreak in Wuhan has put Asian governments on close watch, stepping up preventive measures such as airport temperature screening and notification requirements. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday the city would take ""immediate action"" to contain the spread of suspected pneumonia cases, including screening air passengers traveling from Wuhan. Doctors in the semiautonomous Chinese city must also report patients with symptoms of respiratory diseases to the authorities. A total of 21 people have been found with fever or respiratory symptoms after traveling from Wuhan, according to Hong Kong's Hospital Authority. Seven of them have been discharged, and so far none of them has been linked to the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan. In Singapore, travelers arriving from the Chinese city are also required to go through temperature screening, according to the Ministry of Health. Doctors have been alerted to look out for suspected cases of pneumonia among people who recently returned from there. In South Korea, the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set up a quarantine task force and warned visitors to Wuhan not to touch wild animals or poultry, or visit local markets. Taiwan on Sunday stepped up measures by expanding the conditions for notification of suspected cases of Wuhan pneumonia, according to government-run news agency CNA. A doctor injects a flu vaccination. The World Health Organization said in a statement Sunday that ""there is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology."" It said it does not recommend any specific measures for travelers, and ""advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the current information available on this event."" Fall and winter months are traditionally prone to flu epidemics. In the United States, the current flu season is shaping up to be one of the worst in decades, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases. He said while it is impossible to predict how the flu will play out, the season so far is on track to be as severe as the 2017-18 flu season, which was the deadliest in more than four decades, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

1,1,New virus identified as likely cause of mystery illness in China,2020-01-08,nature,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00020-9,"Passengers arriving at Hong Kong's international airport are being monitored for signs a mystery illness that emerged in central China. Credit: Andy Wong/AP/Shutterstock Update: On 9 January, Chinese state media reported that scientists have identified a new coronavirus as the likely cause of a pneumonia-like illness that has sickened dozens of people. Researchers have sequenced the virus's genome, and fifteen patients have tested positive to the virus , according to Xinhua news agency. Chinese researchers are racing to uncover the cause of a mysterious respiratory illness that has infected almost 60 people in central China. Authorities have ruled out the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds of people there in 2002–03. But missteps during that disaster may explain why scientists are being cautious about releasing information on the latest outbreak, say researchers outside the country. As of 5 January, 59 people in the east-central city of Wuhan have been infected with the mystery virus, with 7 in a critical condition, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. The health commission says that it has also ruled out Middle East respiratory syndrome, avian influenza and other influenza viruses as the cause, based on advice from infectious disease experts in China, including researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which houses one of the country’s premier biosafety laboratories . Symptoms of the illness include fever and difficulty breathing, which are common to several respiratory diseases, according to the World Health Organization, which released an emergency preparedness report on the same day. The municipal health commission says that it is trying to isolate the virus from patients to identify the pathogen and its potential source. Many of the people who have become ill work in a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, which was shut down on 1 January. The health commission says there’s no evidence that the infection is being passed between people, suggesting it is not transmitted easily in humans. The infection is probably an emerging zoonotic virus — infections that spread from animals to humans, says Linfa Wang, a virologist at Duke–National University of Singapore. Such infections often first appear in colder months when animal pathogens can survive and spread to people, he says. But the scientists studying the pathogen are unlikely to release their findings until they’re confident with the result, says Wang, who works on emerging viruses with Chinese research groups but hasn’t been involved in this outbreak. He thinks many scientists will remember how, in the early months of the SARS outbreak before it had been identified as a coronavirus, some Chinese scientists announced prematurely that cases of atypical pneumonia were caused by chlamydia, delaying measures to contain the outbreak. Wang says that this is likely why scientists are being cautious about releasing information about this latest illness. Christian Drosten, a virologist at the Charité – University Medicine Berlin, suspects that the researchers have already identified the virus, but are waiting for government permission to announce their results, or have them confirmed in other laboratories. “There are good reasons to not communicate results early,” he says. Drosten thinks the pathogen might be a coronavirus that is related to SARS, which also points to an animal source. Although the virus currently shows no signs of being transmitted between people, it could develop that capacity over time and lead to and epidemic, says Seungtaek Kim, a virologist at the Institut Pasteur Korea in Seongnam, South Korea. “Since we do not know the identity of this pathogen, it would be safe to treat this outbreak as SARS to prevent further spread,” he says. The health commission has isolated the infected people and is monitoring those in close contact with them, as well as looking for related cases that might have been missed. Authorities in nearby Hong Kong and South Korea have also started screening travelers who have recently been to Wuhan. In Hong Kong, 30 people who had recently visited Wuhan presented with respiratory illness. Authorities say that most had influenza or other infections, but ten of these cases are still unidentified. The current spate of infections seem to be less serious than the 2002–03 SARS outbreak, says Wang, because there have been no deaths, or reports of medical staff becoming ill — usually a sign that an infection is spreading among people and might cause an outbreak.",science,
2,2,China pneumonia outbreak may be caused by Sars-type virus: WHO | Science | The Guardian,2020-01-08,Reuters,theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/09/china-pneumonia-outbreak-may-be-caused-by-sars-type-virus-who,"A cluster of more than 50 pneumonia cases in the central Chinese city of Wuhan may be due to a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly Sars and Mers outbreaks, according to the World Health Organization. While the UN health agency said it needed more comprehensive information to confirm precisely the type of pathogen causing the infections, it said a new coronavirus was a possibility. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). Some of the virus types cause less severe disease, while some – like the one that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) – are far more severe. “The initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan ... pointed to a coronavirus as a possible pathogen causing this cluster,” the WHO said in a statement. It added that since testing by Chinese authorities had eliminated the Sars and Mers coronaviruses as possible causes, as well as flu, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens, “therefore, a novel coronavirus could not be ruled out”. The pneumonia outbreak started last month, and 59 cases had been reported by Chinese authorities by Sunday. The WHO noted that coronaviruses emerge periodically – including in 2002 to cause Sars and in 2012 to cause Mers. It said that according to Chinese authorities, the virus behind the Wuhan cases can cause severe illness in some patients and does not appear to pass easily from person to person. “More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen, as well as to better understand the epidemiology of the outbreak, the clinical picture, the investigations to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection, and the countermeasures implemented,” the WHO said. In 2003, Chinese officials covered up a Sars outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries in 2003. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.",general,

They've found a new coronavirus in 15 of 57 patients with the illness in the central city of Wuhan, Hubei province saying it has been preliminarily identified as the pathogen for the outbreak, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday. The report said the whole genome sequence of the virus has been obtained, and a sample isolated from one of the patients showed ""typical coronavirus appearance"" under an electron microscope. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to SARS, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Symptoms can range from fever and coughing to kidney failure, and in some cases lead to death. Some coronaviruses transmit easily from person to person, while others do not. SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia and spread to 37 countries in 2002 and 2003. A coronavirus is also the culprit for deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) , first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS has since killed 851 people globally, according to the WHO. The SARS virus, a coronavirus like the common cold, is shown in pink in this electron micrograph image from the Centers for Disease Control. Read More But the new coronavirus in Wuhan appears to not be as lethal as SARS or MERS. Its symptoms are mainly fever, with a number of patients having difficulty breathing. Eight patients had recovered and been discharged from hospital as of Wednesday, and no deaths have been reported, according to CCTV. The virus was first detected in Wuhan on December 12. Since then, a total of 59 people have been struck by the illness, with seven patients in critical condition at some stage, Chinese health authorities said on Sunday. Authorities said there has been no obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission, and no healthcare workers have been infected. Some of the patients were employed at a seafood market in Wuhan. Local media reported the market also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes -- sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals. According to the WHO, coronaviruses can infect both humans and animals. The coronavirus that causes SARS was traced to the civet cat , a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of southern China, where the epidemic began. And dromedary camels are considered a likely source of MERS . Professor Leo Poon, a virologist at Hong Kong University and SARS expert, said coronaviruses can be found in many animals, including pigs, cattle, dogs, cats, bats and birds. Six coronaviruses are known to infect humans -- four of them typically cause the common cold, and the other two are SARS and MERS. ""Many of the coronaviruses in animals are harmless to humans. The new strain of coronavirus may have been caused by humans coming into contact with animals that we did not usually have contact with before,"" he said, citing the game sold at the market. Like SARS and MERS, there may not be effective medication directly targeting the new coronavirus, but supportive treatments -- such as assisted respiration and fever relief -- can be provided to cure the symptoms, according to Poon. ""No patient has died from the disease so far, and it appears that the supportive treatments are effective,"" he said. In a statement on Thursday, the WHO said China's preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time demonstrates the country's ""increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.""  In 2003, Chinese officials initially covered up the extent of the SARS outbreak, drawing criticism at home and abroad. ""In the coming weeks, more comprehensive information is required to understand the current status and epidemiology of the outbreak, and the clinical picture. Further investigations are also required to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and countermeasures implemented,"" the WHO statement said. The WHO will continue to monitor the situation and advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available. But across Asia, governments have stepped up preventive measures such as airport temperature screening and notification requirements in the wake of the Wuhan outbreak. A mysterious virus is making China (and the rest of Asia) nervous. It's not SARS, so what is it? On Wednesday, South Korea reported a suspected case linked to the Wuhan pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The patient, a Chinese woman who had visited Wuhan in December, has been isolated and is undergoing treatment and further tests. In Hong Kong, 38 people have been found with fever or respiratory symptoms after traveling from Wuhan, according to the city's Hospital Authority. Among them, 21 have been discharged and so far none has been linked to the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan. In Singapore, travelers arriving from Wuhan are also required to go through temperature screening, according to the Ministry of Health.

4,4,China's Sars-like illness worries health experts | World news | The Guardian,2020-01-09,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley,theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/09/chinas-sars-like-illness-worries-health-experts,"The finding that the outbreak of viral pneumonia in China that has struck 59 people may be caused by a coronavirus, the family of viruses behind Sars, which spread to 37 countries in 2003, causing global panic and killing more than 750 people, means that health authorities will be watching closely. China says the illness is not Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), nor Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome), both of which are caused by coronaviruses, and so far it appears milder than both. Unlike Sars, it does not appear to spread easily between humans and unlike Mers, which has a mortality rate of about 35%, nobody has died. But the identification in preliminary laboratory tests by the Chinese of a novel coronavirus emerging once more from animals to infect humans is worrying for global health experts. When Sars appeared in China in 2002, it was not swiftly identified and contained. It spread around the world – particularly to Canada – via travellers. Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome and an expert in tropical diseases, said: “Epidemics of diseases known and unknown are one of our greatest global health threats – threats that are with us constantly. “A cluster of patients with an unusual respiratory infection is, and should always be, a worry. The level of concern raises again when the illness is linked to an animal food source. This is how new viruses jump across the species barrier – as was the case with Sars, Mers, avian flu and Ebola.” The source of the virus is not yet known but investigations have centred on a market in Wuhan selling live animals and seafood. The origin of Sars was eventually traced to bats in a cave in Yunnan province in China. Dromedary camels are the source of Mers, although it is thought they may also have originally been infected by bats. The World Health Organization said in a statement that the Chinese authorities believed the disease “does not transmit readily between people”, but that it could cause severe illness in some patients. Seven people were known to be critically ill at the weekend. The Chinese authorities have not updated the figures since Sunday. State television said eight people taken to hospital with respiratory problems had been sent home. “More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen, as well as to better understand the epidemiology of the outbreak, the clinical picture, the investigations to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and the countermeasures implemented,” the WHO said. The memory of Sars has already triggered precautionary behaviour in Hong Kong, where people arriving from Wuhan are being screened for the flu-like symptoms of respiratory disease. Some people have been hospitalised, but none has proved to have viral pneumonia of the type found in China. Farrar said one of the key concerns was whether the infection was passing from one person to another. “Are doctors and nurses treating patients, or family members, who have not had the same exposure to the source, also getting sick?” he asked. “If the infection is not passing person to person, then the level of concern is somewhat reduced – although it can always happen later and infections can change.” It appeared that there had not been any newly confirmed cases in Wuhan for about a fortnight, he said, which was reassuring. “The health authorities in China are right, therefore, to take the time necessary to carry out thorough tests and to ensure correct diagnosis. When public health responses are rushed, problems follow – as we saw with early responses to the Nipah outbreak in 1999,” he said. “While early identification of this new virus is testimony to vastly improved monitoring, the global health community still has much to do to address global epidemic preparedness. We are still without a vaccine or treatment for Sars or Mers, which we have long known to be epidemic threats.”",general,

By Dennis NormileJan. 10, 2020 , 12:30 PM SHANGHAI—A new coronavirus identified by Chinese scientists is the putative cause of an outbreak of unusual pneumonia in the central city of Wuhan, according to Chinese news reports yesterday. In an interview today with Science, Xu Jianguo, head of an evaluation committee advising the Chinese government, confirmed that scientists have a complete sequence of the novel virus’s genome. The World Health Organization on 9 January requested sequence data, a spokesperson in Geneva says, and many scientists urge the country to make the sequence public quickly, but the decision is up to the top leadership of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, says Xu, who is director of the Beijing-based State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, part of China CDC. (The center’s head, George Gao, did not respond to emails from Science seeking comment.) Xu says the investigation is being led by China CDC but numerous groups in other government agencies are involved. “Plenty of people are working on the outbreak,” he says. The role of the evaluation committee Xu leads is to review all the findings and make recommendations to the National Health Commission. Xu also said the novel coronavirus resembles known bat viruses, but not the coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The following transcript has been edited for clarity and brevity. Q: The virus has been isolated from one patient, is that correct? A: Correct. Two groups isolated the virus from samples from one patient. The viruses are nearly identical in morphology under electron microscopy. Researchers did laboratory investigations of 34 patients. A total of 15 were positive for the novel virus, [based on] sequencing samples of [fluid injected into the lung and collected for examination]. The teams got complete genome sequence data from about 10 patients. They are now attempting to isolate the virus from those samples as well. There are 19 cases with no evidence of the virus. There is no information available for the results of the remaining 25 cases. Q: How close is this new virus to the SARS coronavirus? A: The virus is similar to some of the published viruses collected from bats. But it is not close to SARS and not close to MERS. Q: Are close contacts of patients and market workers being tested for antibodies to the new virus? A: [Investigators] have just gotten the virus, they now need the chance to prepare reagents for antibody tests, but there are no data yet. Q: The 5 January report from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, the latest available, says a total of 59 pneumonia patients have been identified as possibly carrying the virus. Have more patients been found? A: It should be mentioned that the 59 reported pneumonia patients in Wuhan were clinically diagnosed; of those, 15 were confirmed to be infected by the new coronavirus. No new patients have appeared, as far as I understand. It’s good news. People fear something like SARS in 2003, but this is a different case. The outbreak is limited, but we should test patients one by one [to identify] pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Q: Are researchers trying to replicate the disease in lab animals to prove that it is really the cause of the outbreak? A: People have recommended that [investigators] do tests to see if the virus can cause the infection in animals, but they need time. Q: Is there any progress in tracing the original source of the virus? A: I have no information. Personally, I’m interested, too. The virus looks like viruses isolated from bats, but how it was transmitted from bats to people is still a question. Several groups in China have been working on bat coronaviruses for years. I imagine they’re working on this but so far there is no information. Q: Are other live animal markets being checked? A: The Wuhan market has been closed. I have no information about other [markets]. Wild animals carry the risk of exposing people to new viruses. I think we should have more strict regulations and inspections of markets that sell wild animals, especially since the source of the new coronavirus has not been identified and eliminated.

6,6,Disease X: Mysterious outbreak in China could be new form of virus | Science | News | Express.co.uk,2020-01-10,Sean Martin,express,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1226748/disease-x-china-virus-outbreak-apocalypse-world-health-organisation," The hypothetical outbreak, which has been nicknamed ‘Disease X’ by the World Health Organisation (WHO), could erupt unexpectedly, scientists have warned. And with a mysterious disease affecting tens of people in China, some experts fear the worst. The illness, a pneumonia of unknown origin, was first reported on New Year’s Eve in Wuhan City in Hubei Province. As of January 3, a total of 59 patients have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by the national authorities in China. Experts have ruled out another outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which infected about 8,000 people in 2003, leaving researchers stumped. Gauden Galea, the WHO Representative to China, said: “Further investigations are required to determine the source, modes of transmission.” James Wilson, a paediatrician who has helped monitor health security threats for 25 years, told Business Times: “Disease X is one of the key health security risks in today’s world, and a priority for global monitoring.”   The hypothesised Disease X has the potential to creep up on humanity and wipe out large swathes of the population in a similar fashion to the Spanish Flu, which killed off five percent of the global population, and Russian Flu, which wiped out a million Europeans. Last year, WHO declared Disease X is one of the great potential risks to life and a top priority for research. Scientists have made strides in trying to uncover the unknown and discovered two new viruses in Myanmarese bats. The viruses which were discovered belonged to the coronavirus family which have already caused two outbreaks on Earth.

By Jon CohenJan. 11, 2020 , 3:00 PM Scientists worried about China’s lack of transparency about a month-old outbreak of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan breathed a sigh of relief today, after a consortium of researchers published a draft genome of the newly discovered coronavirus suspected of causing the outbreak. “Potentially really important moment in global public health-must be celebrated, everyone involved in Wuhan, in China & beyond acknowledged, thanked & get all the credit,” Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust in London, wrote in a tweet. “Sharing of data good for public health, great for those who did the work. Just needs those incentives & trust.” Also this morning, Wuhan health authorities reported the first death from the new disease. The patient was a 61-year-old man who frequently visited the live market in Wuhan that most cases have been linked to. He also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease and died on Thursday. The Wuhan Health Commission said 41 people so far have been confirmed to have been infected with the new virus; no new patients have been identified since 3 January. News about the sequence came from Edward Holmes, a virologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney, who tweeted the first notice about the availability of what he referred to as an “initial” sequence of the virus early this morning. Holmes is a member of a consortium led by Yong-Zhen Zhang of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health that posted the sequence on an open-access site, virological.org. The consortium said it had also deposited the sequence in GenBank. In a brief note, the group said researchers were free to analyze and share the data, but asked that groups “communicate with us if you wish to publish results that use these data in a journal.” The analyzing began immediately. Evolutionary biologist Andrew Rambaut at the University of Edinburgh calculated that the virus has a 89% similarity to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related member of the Sarbecoviruses, a subgenus within the Betacoronavirus genus. Potentially really important moment in global public health-must be celebrated … Kevin Olival, vice-president for research of the EcoHealth Alliance, published a phylogenetic tree on Twitter and concurred that the new virus “definitely clusters” with the SARS-related coronaviruses. (Later in the day, Rambaut criticized the fact that Olival did not credit the researchers who isolated the virus and sequenced it. “This is one of the reasons why people are reticent to share data,” Rambaut wrote on Twitter. “No acknowledgement of where the data comes from or who generated it. The [phylogenetic tree] is even branded with a logo.”) Ralph Baric, a coronavirus researcher at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, notes that of the four known SARS-related bat viruses capable of infecting humans, this one is the most distant from SARS itself. After downloading the sequence last night, his lab immediately began to try to reverse-engineer a live virus from the sequence, which can be helpful to develop antibody tests and to start experiments in animal models. “If you want to have a strong public health response, you have to do this quickly,” says Baric, who leads one of the few labs in the world that can re-create coronaviruses just from their sequences. (Bureaucratic hurdles would make it difficult for China to ship the actual virus quickly to other countries, he says.) Baric hopes this virus’s discovery and the response to it illustrate the speed at which scientists can move by working together. “One of the things that’s sad is that the public doesn’t realize how incredibly competent the public health and the basic science community are at going from a newly discovered virus to a tremendous amount of capacity to trace and try to control its spread,” Baric says.

""From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission,"" said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit. The WHO is however preparing for the possibility that there could be a wider outbreak, she told a Geneva news briefing. ""It is still early days, we don't have a clear clinical picture."" Some types of the virus cause less serious diseases, while others - like the one that causes MERS - are far more severe. The U.N. agency has given guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but anti-virals are being considered and could be ""re-purposed"", Van Kerkhove said. With Chinese New Year approaching on Jan. 25, when many Chinese tourists visit Thailand, the WHO called on Thai authorities, the public and holidaymakers to be on alert. Richard Brow, the agency's representative in Thailand, said anyone with a fever and cough who had spent time in Wuhan should get checked out by a health worker.

The WHO has outlined the difficulties the international health community faces in a new report entitled Urgent health challenges for the next decade. It is not a matter of if another pandemic will strike, but when, and when it strikes it will spread fast, potentially threatening millions of lives WHO statement And the global health watchdog warns a lack of adequate preparation leaves the world vulnerable to the next major illness waiting to strike - sometimes referred to as Disease X. The report states: ""Every year, the world spends far more responding to disease outbreaks, natural disasters and other health emergencies than it does preparing for and preventing them."" A new strain of flu to which the majority of people lack immunity poses the gravest risk, the report says.   It adds: ""It is not a matter of if another pandemic will strike, but when, and when it strikes it will spread fast, potentially threatening millions of lives. ""Meanwhile, vector-borne diseases like dengue, malaria, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever are spreading as mosquito populations move into new areas, fanned by climate change."" The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus in China's Wuhan province has underscored the risk posed by future, hitherto-unidentified diseases and WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Express.co.uk investment in strong public health systems represented the best defence against health emergencies.  READ MORE: Tempest Fighter Jet: UK know-how will deliver, says expert  He explained: ""Advance planning and preparedness strategies are key to mitigating the impact of disease outbreaks, pandemics and other health emergencies.""

11,11,China coronavirus outbreak: First case reported outside China - Is it deadly? | World | News | Express.co.uk,2020-01-15,Liam Doyle,express,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1228642/China-coronavirus-outbreak-Wuhan-Thailand-coronavirus-symptoms," Thailand has become the first country outside of China to report a case of a pneumonia-like virus which has already affected dozens of people. Authorities quarantined a tourist in the country who flew in from China’s Wuhan province, where most cases of the virus originated. The latest illness to surface in China is a coronavirus, a species of disease with several strains. Among viruses in the family is the deadly SARS, a respiratory disease which broke out in China from 2002 to 2003 and killed more than 700 people worldwide. Other viruses within the species are less dangerous and present with the severity of the common cold. READ MORE: Measles outbreak CRISIS: Ebola overshadows deadly disease   The most recent strain is not quite as deadly however, as out of the 41 cases, officials have only recorded one death. The person who died was already unwell with “serious underlying medical conditions” according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Human coronaviruses cause infections in the upper respiratory tract, from the larynx to the nasal cavity. Upper-tract infections are the least dangerous and cause a range of symptoms similar to the common cold or flu.  Coronavirus symptoms include: - Runny nose - Headache - Cough - Sore throat - Fever - Feeling generally unwell DON'T MISS Flu symptoms: The unexpected item that could cause the illness - INSIGHTFlu warning: Fungal disease can mix with influenza with deadly effect - INSIGHTMonkeypox virus: Rare viral infection diagnosed in UK - key symptoms - INSIGHT  Coronaviruses can be more dangerous when they spread further down in the body to the lower respiratory tract. When human coronaviruses spread to the lower tract, which includes the lungs, trachea and bronchi, they put more strain on the lungs. Lower tract infections include bronchitis and pneumonia, which can be serious in some cases. Coronaviruses spread differently to the cold or flu, highly contagious diseases which spread through the air via an “aerosol” mechanism. Instead, they rely on close contact to infected fluids, including sweat and blood, meaning the disease has so far only spread within families. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit, said it is “very clear” there is no sustained human-to-human transition. However, Ms Van Kerkhove told a Geneva health briefing “it is still early days” as the disease could still yet develop. WHO has since provided guidance for hospitals around the world about virus prevention and control in case the virus eventually spreads.

12,12,"China's new SARS-like coronavirus has spread to Japan, but we still know very little about it - CNN",2020-01-15,"Nectar Gan, CNN",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/15/asia/wuhan-virus-questions-intl-hnk/index.html,"(CNN) Fears are mounting across Asia over the cross-border spread of a new coronavirus identified in China that has killed one patient and sickened dozens, as health authorities race to identify the source of the pathogen. The new strain of coronavirus, in the same family as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), originated in Wuhan, the largest city in central China. It was confirmed Thursday to have been detected in Japan, a few days after Thailand confirmed its first case of infection. The outbreak has cast a shadow over Lunar New Year celebrations and put the rest of Asia on alert . Virologists around the world are now studying its genome sequence shared by Chinese researchers, but many questions still remain. Researchers have yet to rule out the possibility that the virus could be transmitted from person to person, and on Wednesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a Watch Level 1 Alert -- the lowest of a three-tier travel health notices that warns visitors of Wuhan to ""be aware and practice usual precautions."" Two cases detected outside China Read More On Thursday, Japanese authorities confirmed that a man who had traveled to Wuhan was infected with the virus. The man, in his 30s, lives in the coastal Kanagawa Prefecture just south of Tokyo. He developed a high fever on January 3 while in Wuhan, and returned three days later to Japan, where he was tested positive for the virus, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. He has since recovered and was discharged from hospital on Wednesday, the ministry said. He said he had not visited the seafood market linked to the outbreak while in Wuhan. The confirmation comes just days after Thai authorities said a Chinese tourist arriving from Wuhan had been quarantined with the new virus, the first time it had been detected outside China. According to the World Health Organization, the 61-year-old woman also said she had not been to the seafood market in Wuhan. But she did report ""a history of visiting a local fresh market in Wuhan on a regular basis prior to the onset of illness"" on January 5, the WHO said in a statement. The first, and the majority, of the infected cases in Wuhan have been traced to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, which has been shut down for disinfection since January 1. Wuhan health authorities said on Wednesday that some ""environmental samples"" taken from the market tested positive for the virus. Apart from fish, the market also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes -- sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals, just like SARS and MERS. The seafood market at the center of China's pneunomia outbreak has been closed down. Leo Poon, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong who was among the first to decode the SARS coronavirus, said the Thai case suggests two possibilities: the woman was either infected by an animal in another market, or by another person. The first possibility would mean that the source of the new virus is more widespread than authorities previously believed, and the second would indicate its ability to transmit between humans -- which could turn a local outbreak into a global pandemic. ""I think the first possibility is more likely,"" Poon said. ""This also reiterates the issue of food safety -- the risk of selling exotic animals in markets should be assessed now and new policy should be established as soon as possible."" China -- and the world -- has paid a heavy price for the consumption of wild animals. The SARS epidemic from November 2002 to July 2003 killed 774 people after spreading to 37 countries. The coronavirus was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of southern China, where the epidemic began. But Professor Poon and other experts in Hong Kong said the possibility of human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded. Can it be transmitted between humans? The question of transmission between humans is particularly crucial as China's busy Lunar New Year travel season has recently begun. Hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to be crammed into trains, buses and planes for family reunions. Millions of Chinese are also expected to travel overseas around Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25. Chinese health authorities and the WHO had long maintained that there is no ""obvious evidence"" of human-to-human transmission, and that no health care workers have been infected by the new coronavirus. But early on Friday, while maintaining the lack of clear evidence of such a transmission, Wuhan health authorities said in an announcement that ""the possibility of human to human transmission cannot be excluded."" It reported a case where a couple were infected by the new coronavirus. The husband, who caught the illness first, worked at the Nanhua Wholesale Seafood Market, but the wife said she had no direct exposure to the market. A few other infected patients also denied they had any exposure to the market. Migrant workers wait outside the Guangzhou train station before returning home because of the worry over SARS during the deadly epidemic in 2003. To gain more understanding of the outbreak, a group of Hong Kong experts traveled to Wuhan this week to meet with Chinese authorities and visit the hospital where those infected were quarantined. Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the Communicable Disease department at Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection, said that it is possible that the husband had transmitted the disease to his wife a few days after he was infected, and therefore human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out. But the risk of sustained transmission between humans is low, given that no medical workers have been infected, Chuang said at a press conference on Wednesday. Not as lethal as SARS For now, the new coronavirus appears to not be as lethal or contagious as SARS or MERS. Its symptoms are mainly fever and coughing, with a number of patients having difficulty breathing. A mysterious virus is making China (and the rest of Asia) nervous. It's not SARS, so what is it? As of Thursday, six patients remain in critical condition. Among them, some have renal and liver failures, and two are relying on life support, said Raymond Lai Wai-man, the chief infection control officer of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, who is among the group that visited Wuhan. Compared with 2003, when Chinese officials initially covered up the extent of the SARS outbreak, authorities in the country have been more open and timely in sharing information this time around. Apart from inviting experts from Hong Kong and Taiwan to visit Wuhan, Chinese researchers have also shared the genome sequence of the new coronavirus with the WHO. ""Additional investigation is needed to ascertain the presence of human-to-human transmission, modes of transmission, common source of exposure and the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that are undetected,"" the WHO said in the statement. ""It is critical to review all available information to fully understand the potential transmissibility among humans."" CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report.",general,

In light of the outbreak, the US State Department issued a health alert for all considering travelling to the region on Wednesday. They referenced a Watch Level 1 Alert by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Under the travel alert, the State Department advised citizens to “avoid animals” and to “avoid contact” with any sick people. Moreover, under the alert the State Department also advised anyone who had travelled to the region and become ill, to take extra caution over the deadly virus. The alert level comes as Japan announced its first case of the virus.    According to officials, a man in his 30s tested positive after he had travelled to Wuhan in eastern China. Moreover, a Chinese woman was put into quarantine in Thailand on Monday after authorities discovered she had been infected.

Wuhan has reported 41 cases of pneumonia potentially linked to the new type of virus, as hospitals worldwide scramble to guard against any spread. Now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have announced they are implementing enhanced health screenings to detect ill travellers travelling to the United States on direct or connecting flights the region. As of today, people travelling from Wuhan to the United States will undergo entry screening for symptoms associated with 2019-nCoV at the three US airports which receive most of the travellers from Wuhan: San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX) airports. Martin Cetron MD, Director of CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, said: “To further protect the health of the American public during the emergence of this novel coronavirus, CDC is beginning entry screening at three ports of entry.   Investigations into this novel coronavirus are ongoing and we are monitoring and responding to this evolving situation Martin Cetron “Investigations into this novel coronavirus are ongoing and we are monitoring and responding to this evolving situation.” Based on current information, the risk from 2019-nCoV to the American public is currently deemed to be low - but the CDC is taking what it refers to as “proactive preparedness precautions”.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Homeland Security plans to screen travelers starting Saturday on direct and indirect flights from Wuhan, China to three U.S. airports: John F. Kennedy International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and Los Angeles International airport. Martin Cetron, the director for the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine at the CDC, said in a press briefing Friday that he expects the screening to include as many as 5,000 people coming from Wuhan to the U.S. in the following airports. ""Investigations into this novel coronavirus are ongoing and we are monitoring and responding to this evolving situation,"" he said in a statement. The CDC will monitor the outbreak of the coronavirus, which originally started in Hubei Province, China. There have been two reported deaths and one case confirmed in Thailand and another in Japan. Symptoms of most coronaviruses are similar to any upper-respiratory infection such as a runny nose, coughing, sore throat or fever. It is a part of a large family of viruses that can cause illness in people and animals such as camels, cats and bats. But it's rare for an animal coronavirus to evolve and infect people, according to the CDC. The CDC said the risk of the virus spreading to the American public is considered low. ""Nevertheless, CDC is taking proactive preparedness precautions,"" it said in a statement. The patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China have reportedly said the large seafood and animal market may have resulted in an animal-to-person spread. However, some patients have said that they have not had any exposure to the animal market. Concerns have grown in China since the Chinese health authorities announced the discovery of the mysterious new virus which has sickened dozens of people in Wuhan. Similar viruses in China have occurred in the past, such as the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a virus that killed more than 800 people worldwide in 2002 and 2003. The Greater New York Hospital Association will host a webinar with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene on Jan. 22 to brief hospitals on the developments of the outbreak and the hospital's role in screening and treating patient cases.",finance,

Authorities in China's Wuhan city have confirmed 45 cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus, which is in the same family as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but so far appears to be less lethal. Two people have died, Wuhan authorities say. But the study, by Imperial College London, suggests that an estimated 1,723 people were likely to have been infected by January 12. Officials in China have linked the viral infections to a Wuhan seafood and wildlife market, which has been closed since January 1 to prevent further spread of the illness. Members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team conduct searches on the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. Three travelers -- two now in Thailand and one in Japan -- who visited Wuhan but not the market have been infected with the virus, suggesting human-to-human transmission may be possible and raising concerns of the virus's further spread. Read More The number in the study is only an estimate and is based on several assumptions, including the number of cases that have been exported to Thailand and Japan, the number of people using Wuhan International Airport and the time it has taken for the infection to incubate. Imperial College London's Neil Ferguson, a disease outbreak scientist, said that many aspects of the Wuhan coronavirus were ""highly uncertain."" China's new SARS-like virus has spread to Japan, but we still know very little about it ""However, the detection of three cases outside China is worrying. We calculate, based on flight and population data, that there is only a 1 in 574 chance that a person infected in Wuhan would travel overseas before they sought medical care. This implies there might have been over 1,700 cases in Wuhan so far,"" Ferguson told CNN. ""There are many unknowns, meaning the uncertainty range around this estimate goes from 190 cases to over 4,000. But the magnitude of these numbers suggests that substantial human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out. Heightened surveillance, prompt information sharing and enhanced preparedness are recommended."" Three US airports will start screening passengers arriving from Wuhan to check for signs of the virus, such as coughing, difficulty breathing and high temperatures with the use of an infrared thermometer, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday. The agency is deploying more than 100 people to carry out the screenings at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. Last year, more than 60,000 passengers arrived in the US from Wuhan, the vast majority coming through those three airports. While the new virus has not shown death rates like MERS and SARS -- which infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia in 2002 and 2003 -- so little is known about it that health authorities are calling for vigilance. ""Much remains to be understood about the new coronavirus, which was first identified in China earlier this month. Not enough is known about 2019-nCoV to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted, clinical features of disease, or the extent to which it has spread. The source also remains unknown,"" the World Health Organization said Friday. CNN's Vanessa Yung and Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report.",general,

21,21,Coronavirus: China reports 17 new cases of Sars-like mystery virus | World news | The Guardian,2020-01-19,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/iansample,theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/19/coronavirus-china-reports-17-new-cases-of-sars-like-mystery-virus,"Chinese authorities are to step up efforts to contain the outbreak of a new virus before the lunar new year holidays amid fears of the bug spreading to other countries. Health officials in Wuhan, the city at the heart of the outbreak, confirmed 17 new cases of the Sars-like coronavirus on Sunday, including three patients who are said to be in a severe condition. The new strain has caused alarm because of its connection to severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed more than 750 people globally in 2002-03. Adding to those concerns is the imminent movement of hundreds of millions of Chinese who will be travelling to visit family during the holidays that start next week, increasing the potential for the virus to spread further afield. “Our commission will step up our guard during the spring festival, pay close attention to the development and change of the epidemic, and direct the implementation of prevention and control measures,” China’s national health commission said on Sunday, adding that it believed the outbreak could be controlled. Of the 17 new cases confirmed in Wuhan, three were described as severe and two patients were too critical to be moved, authorities said. Two people have died from the virus in Wuhan, the largest city in central China. Three cases have been confirmed abroad – two in Thailand and one in Japan, involving people either from Wuhan or who had recently visited the city. The virus has infected 62 people in Wuhan, with eight in a severe condition, 19 cured and discharged from hospital, and the rest remaining in isolation where they are receiving treatment. Those infected have ranged from 30 to 79 years old. Authorities said they had begun “optimised” testing of pneumonia cases across the city to identify others infected, and would begin “detection work … towards suspected cases in the city” as a next step, as well as carrying out “sampling tests”. The World Health Organization said on Sunday that some of the new cases did not appear to be linked to the Huanan seafood market, the suspected source of the outbreak. “The fact that three cases have been exported to Thailand and Japan without connection to the Huanan seafood market suggests that the virus has spread beyond the Huanan seafood market into the community,” David Hui, a professor of respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told Reuters. Wuhan’s deputy mayor, Chen Yanxin, said oversight would be strengthened at big events and the number of public gatherings would be reduced, state media reported. Since 14 January, city officials have used infrared thermometers at airports, railways and other routes into the city to screen passengers, but their task is being hampered by this being the peak of the influenza season. Chen said passengers with fevers were being registered, given masks and taken to medical institutions, with nearly 300,000 body temperature tests carried out, according to CCTV. Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London said in a paper published on Friday that the number of cases in the city was likely to be closer to 1,700 – much higher than the number officially identified. No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but Wuhan’s health commission has previously said the possibility “cannot be excluded”. Authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up detection measures, including rigorous temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers from the Chinese mainland. The US said from Friday it would begin screening direct flights arriving from Wuhan at San Francisco airport and New York’s JFK as well as Los Angeles, where many flights connect. Thailand said it was already screening passengers arriving in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket and would soon introduce similar controls in the beach resort of Krabi. Wuhan is a major transport hub, including during the lunar new year holiday when Chinese people make an estimated 3bn trips around the country to visit family.",general,

The Daxing health commission in the capital Beijing said it had confirmed two cases of coronavirus, while the southern Guangdong province's health commission confirmed one case in Shenzhen. They mark the first cases in China beyond the central city of Wuhan where the virus first emerged. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 136 new cases of pneumonia caused by the coronavirus strain had been found in the city over the weekend, adding to 62 already known cases. A third death occurred on Saturday, the authority said in a statement. This brings the total number of known cases worldwide to more than 200, underscoring the challenge for health authorities seeking to contain the outbreak. Hundreds of millions of Chinese tourists will be traveling domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday period that starts later this week. A report by London Imperial College's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis estimated that by Jan. 12 there were 1,723 cases in Wuhan City with onset of related symptoms. Chinese health authorities have not commented directly on the report. Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travelers from Wuhan.

China's National Health Commission said on Sunday it will step up prevention efforts, but acknowledged it still doesn't know the source of the virus. Shares in pharmaceutical firms and mask makers in China surged Monday because of the outbreak. The outbreak was one of the top trending topics on Chinese social media platform Weibo, where many users expressed concerns about their safety. ""Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?,"" one user said. China's Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper, said in an editorial the government needs to disclose all information and not repeat the mistakes made with SARS.

The deadly outbreak has now swept more than 500 miles from Wuhan to China’s largest city, Shanghai, located on the central coast. Authorities in Thailand and in Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China. Three people have so far died from the virus. The virus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002 outbreak that also started in China. Symptoms include fever, chills and shortness of breath.  China’s National Health Commission said experts have judged the current outbreak to be “preventable and controllable”. However, the source and how the virus is transmitted from human-to-human is not yet known. A spokesman for the Commission said: “However, the source of the new type of coronavirus has not been found.  “We do not fully understand how the virus is transmitted, and changes in the virus still need to be closely monitored.” Chinese President Xi Jinping said the health of Chinese citizens is his “top priority” and called for the disease to be “resolutely curbed”.

24,24,New virus surging in Asia rattles scientists,2020-01-20,nature,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00129-x,"A lethal viral outbreak in China probably originated in a Wuhan animal market, which has since been closed. Credit: Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Scientists are increasingly concerned about a new virus that is spreading in Asia. The number of people known to have the respiratory illness, which originated in China, has more than doubled in the past few days. On 20 January, Chinese government officials reported 136 new cases in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, as well as a slew of new cases elsewhere in China. South Korea also reported its first infection. The total number of confirmed cases is now 221: 217 in China and four outside the country. It also now seems that the virus can be spread from person to person, although the extent of such transmissibility is unclear. So far, three people with the illness are known to have died. Why Japan imported Ebola ahead of the 2020 Olympics The surge in new infections is particularly alarming given the approach of the Chinese New Year, the country’s most significant annual holiday. From Friday, hundreds of millions of people will travel back to their home towns or overseas. “This could be the beginning of a disaster,” says Seungtaek Kim, a virologist at the Institut Pasteur Korea in Seongnam, South Korea. The illness was first detected last December among people who had visited a live-animal market in the city of Wuhan. But on 20 January, officials in South Korea reported the country’s first case of the virus, which belongs to the same coronavirus family as the pathogen that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and that killed hundreds of people between 2002 and 2003. The South Korea detection comes after two people in Thailand and one in Japan tested positive last week. The virus is also being detected more widely within China. Shenzhen and Beijing reported their first cases over the weekend. On 20 January, there were 5 confirmed cases in Beijing, and 14 in Guandong province, where Shenzhen is located. The total in Wuhan was 198 and there were 7 suspected cases elsewhere in China. This Nigerian doctor might just prevent the next deadly pandemic The World Health Organization has moved to subdue rising panic. On Twitter, it said that the increase in cases was the result of authorities increasing their searching and testing of people already sick with respiratory illnesses. It said that some human-to-human transmission was occurring between people in close contact, but that an animal seems the most likely primary source of the virus. China’s National Health Commission has also tried to allay fears. Cases jump But some scientists are concerned that the jump in new cases, and the outbreak’s geographic spread, might suggest that the virus is spreading more quickly than is currently reported by authorities. The initial cases were traced back to the live-animal market in Wuhan. But although the market has been shut since 1 January, new cases continue to be reported, including in people who had not visited the market. Machine learning helps to identify the animals that deadly viruses call home The latest cases probably include some of the ‘first generation’ human-to-human infections, says Linfa Wang, director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. If people are newly infected in other locations where the virus has since shown up, including Japan, Thailand, Beijing and Shenzhen, they are likely be part of a second generation of human-to-human cases, he says. A group led by researchers at Imperial College London estimate that, on the basis of its simulations of travel in and out of Wuhan , some 1,700 people have been infected with the coronavirus. Airports in the United States, South Korea, Japan and other countries have already started to screen passengers from Wuhan for signs of infection. Earlier this month, Chinese scientists announced that they had identified the new virus — and that it was the cause of the infections. Since then, research groups have sequenced six different samples of the virus. Although the new coronavirus is related to the virus that causes SARS, so far it lacks the transmissibility of SARS, says Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist at the University of Tokyo. It has also caused only 3 deaths among the more than 200 people it is known to have infected, whereas SARS killed some 15% of those it infected, and about half of those over 60 years old . But the new virus could mutate into something more easily transmitted and more virulent, says Kawaoka. Pandemics: spend on surveillance, not prediction Scientists will need to keep sequencing the virus to know how it is evolving, says Kim, and to make sure that detection tests don’t miss cases. It is also crucial that China identifies the animal source of the virus so that proper measures can be taken to limit its spread, he says. Scientists outside China are hungry for information about the infected people, such as the exact dates they fell ill and whether they had been to a live-animal market, notes Kim. “China needs to share more appropriate information and as soon as possible,” says Kim. “The disease is no longer confined within the country. A virus doesn’t know borders.”",science,

There are now more than 200 cases, mostly in Wuhan, though the respiratory illness has also been detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Three people have died. Japan, Thailand and South Korea have reported cases. The new strain of coronavirus, which causes a type of pneumonia, can pass from person to person, China confirmed. Respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, who heads the health commission team investigating the virus, said 14 medical workers had caught it while treating patients, state media reported. The sharp rise comes as millions of Chinese prepare to travel for the Lunar New Year holidays. Although the outbreak is believed to have originated from a market, officials and scientists are yet to determine exactly how it has been spreading. The outbreak has revived memories of the Sars virus - also a coronavirus - that killed 774 people in the early 2000s across dozens of countries, mostly in Asia.  Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus. Experts in the UK told the BBC the number of people infected could still be far greater than official figures suggest, with estimates closer to 1,700. Source: World Health Organization Authorities in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million that has been at the heart of the outbreak, on Monday said 136 new cases had been confirmed over the weekend, with a third person dying of the virus. There had previously been only 62 confirmed cases in the city. As of late Sunday, officials said 170 people in Wuhan were still being treated in hospital, including nine in critical condition. Beijing also confirmed its first cases, with five people infected. Shanghai confirmed its first case on Monday - a 56-year-old woman who came from Wuhan. In the city of Shenzhen, a major tech hub close to Hong Kong, officials said a 66-year-old man showed symptoms of the virus following a trip to visit relatives in Wuhan. State media reported 14 other cases in Guangdong province. Four cases have been confirmed abroad - two in Thailand, one in Japan and one in South Korea - all of them involving people who are either from Wuhan or have visited the city. In South Korea, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a 35-year-old Chinese woman was suffering from a fever and respiratory problems after travelling there from Wuhan. She was put into isolation and treated at a local hospital. The World Health Organization said it was currently not recommending restrictions on travel or trade, but was providing guidance to countries preparing for any outbreak. Airports in Singapore, Hong Kong and the Japanese capital Tokyo have been screening air passengers from Wuhan, and US authorities last week announced similar measures at three major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. How China is responding to the outbreak is under close scrutiny, given that it was widely criticised for initially covering up the Sars crisis in late 2002 and early 2003. On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time publicly addressed the outbreak, saying that the virus must be ""resolutely contained"". The foreign ministry, meanwhile, said China was providing ""timely information about the disease"" and would ""work with all parties to deal with the virus"". China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed that two cases in China were due to human-to-human transmission, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The commission had earlier said there had been no such cases, but that the virus had instead crossed the species barrier and come from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. The WHO also said it believed there had been ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts"". ""As more… cases are identified and more analysis undertaken, we will get a clearer picture of disease severity and transmission patterns,"" it wrote on Twitter. It noted that the rise in cases in China was a result of ""increased searching and testing for [the virus] among people sick with respiratory illness"". From Friday, most Chinese will begin their week-long Lunar New Year holidays. It's a time when hundreds of millions travel around China to visit family, raising fears that authorities will not be able to adequately monitor further spread of the disease. Wuhan is a transport hub and authorities there have for nearly a week been using temperature scanners at airports, and train and bus stations. Those showing signs of fever have been registered, given masks and taken to hospitals and clinics. Authorities say they will now also be screening everyone leaving the city.

China’s National Health Commission confirmed that the virus, which causes a type of pneumonia, can pass from person-to-person, the official Xinhua News Agency said. President Xi Jinping said curbing the outbreak and saving lives was a top priority as the number of patients more than tripled and a third person died. Adding to the difficulties of containing it, hundreds of millions of Chinese will be travelling domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday that starts this week. Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travellers from Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first discovered. “Wuhan is a major hub and with travel being a huge part of the fast approaching Chinese New Year, the concern level must remain high. There is more to come from this outbreak,” said Jeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity. Authorities confirmed a total of 217 new cases of the virus in China as of 6 p.m. local time (1000 GMT) on Monday, state television reported, 198 of which were in Wuhan. Five new cases were confirmed in Beijing and 14 more in Guangdong province, the report said. Another statement confirmed a new case in Shanghai, bringing the number of known cases worldwide to 222. “People’s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed,” President Xi was quoted as saying by state television.

Some medical staff have been infected, it added, but gave no number. South Korea on Monday confirmed its first case, a 35-year-old Chinese national who had travelled from Wuhan, the fourth patient reported outside China. Last week, two cases were reported in Thailand and one in Japan. All three involved people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city. A report by London Imperial College’s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis estimated that by Jan. 12 there were 1,723 cases in Wuhan City with onset of related symptoms. Chinese health authorities have not commented directly on the report. “This outbreak is extremely concerning. Uncertainty and gaps remain, but it is now clear that there is person to person transmission,” Farrar said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday “an animal source” appeared most likely to be the primary source of the outbreak and that some “limited human-to-human transmission” occurred between close contacts. The Geneva-based U.N. agency later convened an emergency committee for Wednesday to assess whether the outbreak constitutes an international health emergency and what measures should be taken to manage it. So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions, but a panel of independent experts could do so or make other recommendations to limit spread.

Authorities earlier reported 139 new cases of the new strain of coronavirus over the weekend, bringing the total number of infected patients to 217 since the virus was first detected last month in the central city of Wuhan. It was also confirmed on Tuesday that an 89-year-old man had died from the virus in Wuhan, bringing the number of fatalities to four. It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 4 April, more than 1.1m people have been infected in more than 170 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 58,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 14,600 fatalities, and there have been over 11,000 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 278,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 226,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus. Cases were confirmed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong province in the south, heightening fears ahead of the lunar new year holiday, when more than 400 million people are expected to travel domestically and internationally. State broadcaster CCTV said on Monday evening there were seven suspected cases in other parts of the country, including Shandong in the east, and the south-western provinces of Sichuan, Guangxi and Yunnan. Five people who travelled from Wuhan were also being treated for fevers in Zhejiang province. “People’s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed,” said China’s president, Xi Jinping, weighing in on the matter for the first time. The strain has caused alarm because of its connection to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03. The current outbreak has spread to Thailand, Japan and South Korea. A man was in isolation in Brisbane, Australia after being suspected of having the virus after he returned from a visit to Wuhan. China’s National Health Commission said it had sent working groups to all provinces to oversee outbreak prevention, describing the situation as “controllable”. Hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing and in Zhejiang province have “comprehensively” strengthened examination procedures. In Shenzhen, temperature checks have been put in place in airports, ports and railway stations. More than 100 patients with symptoms were waiting to be seen at the Xiehe hospital in Wuhan at 6am on Monday. “If you are coming now, you have to wait between three and four hours before you can see the doctors,” a hospital worker said by phone. At a hospital in Chaoyang district in Beijing, patients were being given masks and forms to fill out, detailing any recent travel to Wuhan. A nurse said preventive measures were also being taken to protect doctors Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people, and the outbreak in Wuhan has been linked to a now-closed seafood market where live animals were reportedly sold. The World Health Organization has said an animal source was “the most likely primary source” of the outbreak, with “some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts”. Researchers worry the number of infections has been severely underestimated. The WHO said it would convene an emergency meeting in Geneva on Wednesday to discuss whether the new coronavirus constituted an international health emergency. Xi Chen, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said the likelihood of human-to-human transmission had appeared large given how many cases were confirmed. “It’s hard to see all these cases coming from animals at the same market,” Chen said. For weeks, the only reported cases were in Wuhan and areas outside mainland China, prompting many people to question whether other cities were simply not reporting or testing for the virus. Some internet users joked the virus appeared to be “patriotic” by only spreading beyond China’s borders. Chen said the high cost of testing for diagnosis may have contributed to underreporting. Authorities have still not identified the source of the infection, which further complicates the government’s ability to contain the outbreak. The Huanan seafood market, where thousands of traders sold products, has been closed since 1 January. But some of the detected cases are patients with no history of visiting the market. “What concerns me is the source of infection. We have no idea. That’s the most important thing. Without knowing that we don’t know the harm, how hard it can be,” Chen said. Others fear that authorities have not moved quickly enough to contain the spread of the virus or educate the public. In Wuhan, temperature checkpoints have been installed at the airport and at train stations and bus terminals since 14 January, about five weeks after the virus was first detected. Observers and residents worry about the possibility of a cover-up worsening the outbreak, as was the case with Sars in 2003. Some residents in Wuhan have been told not to speak to media. The official Weibo account of Wuhan police said on 1 January that eight internet users who spread false information online “causing adverse social impacts” had been dealt with “according to the law”. But Chinese health officials have made improvements since the Sars episode. In response to a bird flu outbreak in 2013, authorities quickly worked with the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fresh food markets were shut down but the outbreak was exacerbated by poultry sales into smaller, less-regulated markets. The situation is complicated by the fact that farmers are unlikely to be compensated by the government or give up their sick animals. “It’s not about a cover-up. Rather it’s about a lack of capacity and about a lack of enforced regulation,” said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor focusing on health security at City University of Hong Kong. “At the moment, it is a bad flu. Yes, it is something to be concerned about and it is probably going to get worse in terms of infections and mortality, but again it’s winter,” he said. “It is likely to spread but we are still a long way off the levels of Sars or bird flu.” The state-run Global Times said in an editorial on Sunday: “In the early days of Sars, there was a cover-up and delayed reporting. Such things can never be repeated again in China.” Authorities have advised residents in the run-up to the lunar new year, which falls on 25 January, to be on the lookout for symptoms including fever, coughs, breathing difficulties and pneumonia. Millions of people will crisscross the country during a weeklong public holiday starting on 24 January, in what is known as humanity’s largest migration. Some of those travelling will have set off already. The WHO has not recommended any travel restrictions and Chinese authorities have not yet issued any. Still, not all residents were comforted by government assurances. “With this huge amount of spring festival travel, why are there not any prevention measures?” one wrote on Weibo. On the Douban forum, another observed that few people at Wuhan train station were wearing masks. Traders at the now-closed suspected seafood market in Wuhan said they were not overly worried, seeing the virus as little more than the common cold. “We start early, at 2am or 3am. We put our hands in the cold water. If we catch a cold, we don’t pay it much attention,” said Li, 52, who has operated a stall in Huanan for most of the past decade. Li said that starting from late December, the property developer that owned the market asked renters to wear masks to work and avoid going to crowded places. “I’m not worried,” said Li. “My grandchildren all live in Wuhan and we don’t believe it. It’s just rumours.” However, Li said some tenants who might have shown symptoms of the virus were unlikely to have reported themselves, fearing the impact on their business and being quarantined. “Most people wouldn’t say if they had it,” he said.

29,29,Dog food alert: Food Standards Authority issues immediate recall after salmonella found | UK | News | Express.co.uk,2020-01-20,Bill McLoughlin,express,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1230880/dog-food-salmonella-food-standards-agency-happy-hounds-uk-news," An immediate recall has been issued after traces of salmonella were found in certain products. The discovery was made in the Happy Hounds brand, who is now recalling three types of its frozen food range. A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said: “Our advice to pet owners: if you have bought any of the above products do not use them. “Instead, return them to the store from where they were bought for a full refund. “When handling and serving raw pet food it is always advised to clean utensils and feeding bowls thoroughly after use. “Consumers should wash hands thoroughly after handling raw pet food, bowls, utensils or after contact with the faeces of animals.   “Raw pet food should be stored separately from any food especially ready to eat foods. “Care should be taken when defrosting to avoid cross-contamination of foods and surfaces.” Points of sale notices will be put up in all stores which sell the food. These notices explain why the food has been recalled and offer advice to anyone who has bought the product. JUST IN: Coronavirus crisis: Fears of pandemic grow as three die  There are three products which have been identified as being at risk of the bacteria. Frozen chicken and beef sleeve food and frozen chicken mince sleeve food at a weight of 1kg, batch code 1205. The remaining food is frozen chicken mince, weighing 2.5kg with the same batch code. Salmonella can cause illness in both humans and animals.

Unfortunately, infected animals may not display signs of the bacteria unless it progresses to diarrhoea. Moreover, the bacteria can be contracted by handling the product. Special notice has also been issued due to the infection being transmitted by touching any feeding bowls or utensils which have been in contact with the product. The warning from the FSA comes after Waitrose was forced to recall its two-pack of Aberdeen Angus burgers on January 15. The warning was for any customer with an allergy or intolerance to wheat or gluten. The FSA released a statement of the recall of the product: “Waitrose is recalling the above product from customers and has been advised to contact the relevant allergy support organisations, which will tell their members about the recall.  “The company has also issued a point-of-sale notice to its customers. “These notices explain to customers why the product is being recalled and tell them what to do if they have bought the product.” See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general,
30,30,China coronavirus outbreak: China virus threatens a repeat of 2002 SARS pandemic | Science | News | Express.co.uk,2020-01-20,Sebastian Kettley,express,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1230786/China-coronavirus-outbreak-China-virus-pneumonia-SARS-pandemic-Wuhan-China-news," The coronavirus has infected at least 200 people across China but the numbers are disputed and could be higher. At least three people have died from pneumonia-like symptoms and 139 new infections were recorded over the weekend alone. The coronavirus strain has mostly been contained to Beijing, Shenzhen and Wuhan where the outbreak began in December 2019. Four cases of the virus have been confirmed abroad and some experts fear the number of infected could be in the thousands. The coronavirus spreading through China belongs to a family of viruses responsible for the 2002 SARS pandemic. SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, infected more than 8,000 people across 37 countries and killed at least 774 people. READ MORE: US begins screening travellers after second coronavirus death   The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the China virus is a new strain that has not been previously identified. The disease is most likely spreading through contact with infected animals, food and possibly through bodily fluids. According to biologists Klaudia Zając and Adrian Zając of the Marie Curie-Skłodowska University in Lublin, Poland, another SARS-like epidemic has been on the table since 2002. The researchers wrote in a joint-study: “Unfortunately, knowledge of these pathogens is still inadequate and the dangers carried by coronavirus infections are very real. “These days people travel a lot, including very distant and exotic countries and so the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic, could turn out very dangerous since the virus could spread globally very quickly.  “This is why it’s important to work out the most successful methods of treating respiratory infections caused by viruses from the coronaviridae family, as well as preventing these infections to limit the pathogen’s ability to attack as much as possible.” Unfortunately, knowledge of these pathogens is still inadequate Klaudia Zając and Adrian Zając, Marie Curie-Skłodowska University The coronavirus study, penned before China’s outbreak, analysed the potential threat posed by the virus family. The researchers noted very little is known about the pathogens and new strains keep emerging. Since the original outbreak of SARS, scientists have found three new coronavirus strains – the China virus is the fourth. DON’T MISSHow many people have REALLY been infected by the China virus? [ANALYSIS]China's rapidly spreading virus is 'really concerning' [INTERVIEW]China virus claims lives as China struggles to contain outbreak [INSIGHT]   In 2012, for instance, the virus triggered an outbreak of MERS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. MERS infections have been recorded in countries such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia, leading to at least 400 deaths. The Polish researchers wrote: “Exactly 10 years since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV epidemic – in 2012 – cases of a new, equally dangerous infectious disease dubbed MERS – Middle East Respiratory Syndrome – caused by the MERS-CoV virus were recorded. “So far, a global epidemic of this dangerous disease has not erupted but the danger is high since the number of infections and deaths is rising year on year. “Therefore, there is a fear the 2002 situation could repeat itself.” Chinese authorities on Sunday claimed the coronavirus outbreak was “still preventable and controllable”. China’s National Health Commission said the source of the outbreak is yet to be determined but the virus first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province. According to the WHO, common symptoms of infection include fever, coughing, shortness of breath and other breathing problems. In more severe cases, the WHO warned the virus can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death. However, as of January 20, the WHO did not recommend any travel restrictions yet.

31,31,What is coronavirus? COVID-19 explained - CNN,2020-01-20,"Jen Christensen and Meera Senthilingam, CNN",cnn,http://www.cnn.com/2020/01/20/health/what-is-coronavirus-explained/index.html,"(CNN) A new Chinese coronavirus, a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected hundreds since the outbreak began in Wuhan , China, in December. Scientist Leo Poon, who first decoded the virus, thinks it likely started in an animal and spread to humans. ""What we know is it causes pneumonia and then doesn't respond to antibiotic treatment, which is not surprising, but then in terms of mortality, SARS kills 10% of the individuals,"" Poon, a virologist at the School of Public Health at The University of Hong Kong, said. It's not clear how deadly the Wuhan coronavirus will be, but fatality rates are currently lower than both MERS and SARS. Experts stress that it will change as the outbreak develops. China confirms new coronavirus can spread between humans The World Health Organization offered guidance to countries on how they can prepare for it, including how to monitor for the sick and how to treat patients. Here's what you should know about coronaviruses. What is a coronavirus? Read More Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals . In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Coronavirus symptoms The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness , similar to a common cold. Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days. For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis. There are a handful of human coronaviruses that are known to be deadly. Middle East respiratory syndrome , also known as the MERS virus, was first reported in the Middle East in 2012 and also causes respiratory problems, but those symptoms are much more severe. Three to four out of every 10 patients infected with MERS died, according to the CDC. Severe acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS, is the other coronavirus that can cause more severe symptoms. First identified in the Guangdong province in southern China, according to the WHO , it causes respiratory problems but can also cause diarrhea, fatigue, shortness of breath, respiratory distress and kidney failure. Depending on the patient's age, the death rate with SARS ranged from 0-50% of the cases, with older people being the most vulnerable. The Wuhan coronavirus is currently thought to be more mild than SARS and MERS and takes longer to develop symptoms. Patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, causing them to visit the hospital, explains Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford. So far, around 15% to 20% of cases have become severe, requiring, for example, ventilation in the hospital. How it spreads Viruses can spread from human contact with animals. Scientists think MERS started in camels, according to the WHO. With SARS, scientists suspected civet cats were to blame. Officials do not yet know what animal may have caused the current outbreak in Wuhan. When it comes to human-to-human transmission of the viruses, often it happens when someone comes into contact with an infected person's secretions, such as droplets in a cough. Depending on how virulent the virus is, a cough, sneeze or handshake could cause exposure. The virus can also be transmitted by touching something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. Caregivers can sometimes be exposed by handling a patient's waste, according to the CDC. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed for the Wuhan coronavirus, but experts are now trying to understand who is transmitting it most, who is at most risk and whether transmission is occurring mostly in hospitals or in the community. SARS and MERS were largely transmitted inside hospitals, Horby said. Some people are also considered to be ""superspreaders."" Who is affected? MERS, SARS and the Wuhan coronavirus appear to cause more severe disease in older people, though uncertainty remains around the latest outbreak. Of the cases of Wuhan coronavirus reported so far, none are yet confirmed to be among children, Horby said. The average age is people 40 or over, he said. Coronavirus treatment There is no specific treatment, but research is underway. Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own and experts advise seeking care early. If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see your doctor. Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication. The CDC says a room humidifier or a hot shower can help with a sore throat or cough. Drink plenty of fluids, get rest and sleep as much as possible. Should you worry about the Wuhan coronavirus? The Wuhan coronavirus fatality rate is lower than for SARS and MERS, but still comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, explains  Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London. ""It is a significant concern, globally,"" Ferguson says, noting that we don't fully understand the severity. Ferguson believes the fatality rate is likely to be lower due to an ""iceberg"" of milder cases we are yet to find, but he highlights that novel viruses spread much faster through a population. How can you can prevent it? There is no vaccine to protect against this family of viruses, at least not yet. Trials for a MERS vaccine are underway. The US National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine against the new virus, but it will be months until clinical trials get underway and more than a year until it might become available. You may be able to reduce your risk of infection by avoiding people who are sick. Try to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds. Awareness is key. If you are sick and have reason to believe it may be the Wuhan coronavirus due to travel to the region or coming into contact with someone who has been there, you should let a health care provider know and seek treatment early. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch. If traveling to China, be aware of symptoms and avoid live animal markets, which is where the latest outbreak began in Wuhan. Coronavirus and pregnancy In pregnant women, the more severe versions of MERS and SARS coronaviruses can be serious. There are cases in which a woman infected with MERS had a stillbirth, a 2014 study showed. SARS-associated illnesses were linked to cases of spontaneous abortion, maternal death and critical maternal illness, a 2004 study found . Coronavirus and cats, dogs and other animals Pets can catch coronaviruses and the infections can become severe. Sometimes the viruses can lead to deadly diseases. One can cause feline infectious peritonitis in cats and something called a pantropic canine coronavirus can infect cats and dogs, according to a 2011 study. Cats can catch SARS, but none of the infected cats developed symptoms, according to the study. The feline coronavirus typically is asymptomatic, but can cause mild diarrhea. Feline infectious peritonitis , or FIP, can cause flu-like symptoms for a cat, but can also be more serious for cats and can cause organ failure, but it is not contagious and will not spread from animal to animal or person to person. Pantropic canine coronavirus that can impact cats and dogs can be fatal to dogs, studies show. These particular dog and cat viruses don't seem to spread to humans.

32,32,China confirms new coronavirus can spread between humans - CNN,2020-01-20,"Nectar Gan, Yong Xiong and Eliza Mackintosh, CNN",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/19/asia/china-coronavirus-spike-intl-hnk/index.html,"Beijing (CNN) A mysterious respiratory virus that has killed at least three people and sickened more than 200 in China can be transmitted between humans, a Chinese government-appointed expert has said, fueling fears about the possibility of a deadly epidemic as millions prepare to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday . Zhong Nanshan, head of the team set up by China's National Health Commission to investigate the pneumonia-like virus, confirmed that at least two cases had been spread from person to person and medical staff had also been infected. Authorities had previously said that the new strain of coronavirus , which was traced by health officials to a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, was primarily passed from animals to humans. But at least two people have become infected in recent days, despite living hundreds of miles from Wuhan. ""The current cases show there is definitely human-to-human transmission,"" Zhong told Chinese state-run CCTV, explaining that two people in China's Guangdong province were infected by a family member who had recently returned from Wuhan. Read More Zhong, who helped discover the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS) in 2003, said the infectiousness of this virus was not as strong as SARS, but that the disease was ""climbing"" and suggested that the ""death rate at the moment is not so representative."" SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia in 2002 and 2003. Earlier on Monday, Chinese authorities reported that the number of cases had tripled over the weekend to 218. The outbreak has spread to Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzen, hundreds of miles from Wuhan, where the virus first surfaced last month. Thailand has also reported two cases, while Japan and South Korea reported one each, taking the global total to 222. Fears of major outbreak amid busy travel period The spread of the outbreak comes as the country gets ready for the Lunar New Year holiday later this week. On Sunday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that there was evidence of ""limited human-to-human transmission"" of the new virus raising fears of a wider regional outbreak. The holiday period typically sees hundreds of millions of Chinese travel throughout the country and overseas. 3 billion journeys: World's biggest human migration begins in China The three cases outside China have all been linked to Wuhan. On Monday, South Korea also confirmed its first case of the virus. According to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a 35-year-old Chinese woman was detected by temperature screening upon arriving Sunday at Seoul's Incheon International Airport from Wuhan. She has been quarantined and is in a stable condition, the CDC said. The woman, a Wuhan resident, had planned to go on holiday in South Korea and Japan with five others. She said she developed a fever and muscle pains on Saturday and was prescribed cold medicine by a doctor in Wuhan, according to the CDC. Almost 7 million Chinese were estimated to have traveled overseas last year during the Lunar New Year holiday season. ""I believe Chinese tourists will bring the virus to many other countries in Asia in the coming days, due to their overseas travels during the Lunar New Year holiday,"" Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told CNN Monday. Study suggests infections may be underestimated The pneumonia outbreak emerged last month in Wuhan, the largest city in central China and a major transportation hub. Officials in China have linked the viral infections to a Wuhan seafood and wildlife market, which has been closed since January 1 to prevent further spread of the illness. Chinese scientists on January 8 identified the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus, in the same family of the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Pharmaceutical stocks spike after China reports new coronavirus cases While the new virus has not shown death rates like SARS, a new study by Imperial College London suggests the number of infections in Wuhan is likely to have been grossly underestimated . ""The detection of three cases outside China is worrying. We calculate, based on flight and population data, that there is only a 1 in 574 chance that a person infected in Wuhan would travel overseas before they sought medical care. This implies there might have been over 1,700 cases in Wuhan so far,"" Imperial College London's Neil Ferguson, a disease outbreak scientist, told CNN. On Friday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced three US airports -- in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles -- will start screening passengers arriving from Wuhan to check for signs of the new virus, following similar measures taken by governments in Asia. In Wuhan, infrared thermometers have been installed at the airport, train stations, coach terminals and passenger piers to measure the temperature of passengers departing the city since January 14, Chen Xiexin, deputy mayor of Wuhan, was quoted as saying by state-media China Daily on Sunday. The measures were only imposed five weeks after the onset of the outbreak, with countless passengers having left the city without screening.

33,33,Wuhan pneumonia: New cases amid China travel season ahead of Lunar New Year,2020-01-20,Huileng Tan@huileng_tan,cnbc,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/20/wuhan-pneumonia-new-cases-amid-china-travel-season-ahead-of-lunar-new-year.html,"Health authorities in China on Monday confirmed nearly 140 new cases of a mysterious pneumonia-like virus, which has killed three people so far. It comes as the country's peak holiday travel season kicks off ahead of the Lunar New Year, sparking concerns over the spread of the viral strain and its possible impact on economic growth. ""It's highly likely we'll see this virus spread given that it appears there's some form of human-to-human transmission and given the scale of travel in the lead-up to Chinese New Year,"" said Alexandra Phelan, faculty research instructor in the microbiology and immunology department at Georgetown University. ""Looking further on, I think we're likely to have cases around China and also there will likely be cases in other countries as people travel,"" Phelan told CNBC on Monday. While the Sars-virus first emerged in the central city of Wuhan in late December, the 139 new cases that appeared over the weekend in China showed new cases in the capital of Beijing in the north of the country, as well as in the southern city of Shenzhen, Reuters reported. This brings the total to more than 200 confirmed cases from the new coronavirus strain. Three of them have died. Hundreds of millions of Chinese travelers are expected to travel both domestically and internationally as Lunar New Year starts this Saturday, igniting fears of a further spread of the virus and kindling memories of the fatal Sars pandemic in 2002 and 2003 that killed nearly 800 globally. The Sars pandemic — also caused by a coronavirus — cost the global economy tens of billions of dollars. On Monday, South Korea confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus in a Chinese woman who flew to Incheon International Airport from Wuhan. Two cases have also been reported in Thailand and one in Japan. They involved two Chinese from Wuhan and a resident in Japan who had travel history to the city — where the virus is linked to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting that the virus had jumped from animals to humans, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its website. However, some of the patients have not had exposure to the animal markets, ""suggesting that some limited person-to-person spread is occurring,"" the CDC said Friday. Airport authorities around the world have already stepped up health screening of travelers at their borders to pick up suspected cases. Measures include temperature screening. However, as symptoms from the new Wuhan coronavirus infection are similar to that of other respiratory conditions, there will be ""a lot"" of travelers who would be wrongly picked up alongside, Phelan said. ""They can be a useful opportunity to provide people with information if they do feel sick ... but most of the time, border screening is actually a very expensive, not particularly effective way of actually preventing the spread of disease,"" said Phelan. While the nature and severity of the new coronavirus is still under investigation, it could pose a major risk to Asia Pacific economies, experts said. ""Human-to-human transmission will be (the) tipping point, and mass movements in China during CNY (Chinese New Year) may be an unwelcomed accelerant,"" said Vishnu Varathan, Asia head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank. In particular, the ""fear factor"" posed by the uncertainties that come with the new coronavirus could send economic activity grinding down rapidly and ""hijack signs of bottoming/recovery in economic activity,"" Varathan said in an email to CNBC. On Monday, shares of Chinese drugmakers and face mask-makers soared amid rising concerns over the outbreak. Recent data out of China have suggested some bottoming out of the country's economy that was hit due to its bitter trade war with the U.S. ""The 2003 Sars crisis created a severe negative impact on GDP growth for the Chinese economy and also hit the economies of a number of Southeast Asian nations, including Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam,"" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit. There could also be a ripple effect elsewhere, he added.

Zhong Nanshan said there was no danger of a repeat of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic that killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-2003 outbreak, which started in China, as long as precautions were taken. ""It took only two weeks to identify the novel coronavirus,"" state news agency Xinhua quoted Zhong as saying late on Monday. The outbreak was still in its early stages and China had good surveillance and quarantine systems to help control it, he added. The outbreak has spread from the central city of Wuhan to cities including Beijing and Shanghai, with more than 200 cases reported so far. Four cases have been reported outside China — in South Korea, Thailand and Japan. Australia on Tuesday said it would screen passengers on flights from Wuhan amid rising concerns that the virus will spread globally as Chinese travelers take flights abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday starting this week. Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travelers from Wuhan. Chinese authorities confirmed a total of 217 cases of the virus in China as of 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Monday, state television reported, 198 of which were in Wuhan. A fourth person died on Jan. 19, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said. The 89-year-old man, who had underlying health diseases including coronary heart disease, developed symptoms on Jan. 13 and was admitted to hospital five days later, it added. Zhong, who is renowned in China for his work fighting SARS in 2003, confirmed that the virus can pass from person-to-person. Fifteen medical workers in Wuhan had been diagnosed with pneumonia, with one other suspected case, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said. Of the infected staff, one was in critical condition. In Shanghai, officials on Tuesday confirmed a second case involving a 35-year-man who had visited Wuhan in early January, and said they were monitoring four other suspected cases. The virus causes a type of pneumonia and belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as SARS. Symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for screening efforts. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday an animal source appeared most likely to be the primary origin of the outbreak and that some ""limited human-to-human transmission"" occurred between close contacts. The Geneva-based U.N. agency convened an emergency committee for Wednesday to assess whether the outbreak constitutes an international health emergency and what measures should be taken to manage it. So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions, but a panel of independent experts could do so or make other recommendations to limit spread.",finance,

Meanwhile, shares of face mask firms also got a boost, with Tianjin Teda soaring 9.89% while Shanghai Dragon surged about 10%. The stocks moves came after authorities in China reported on Monday that 139 new cases of coronavirus had been discovered over the weekend, Reuters reported. Three of the new cases had come from places outside the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first reported. For its part, China's National Health Commission said in a release on Sunday that experts have deemed the current situation ""still preventable and controllable,"" according to CNBC's translation of the original Chinese text. ""What has been evident by the most recent statistics that have come out overnight ... is that it is highly likely that we have this human-to-human transmission occurring,"" Alexandra Phelan, faculty instructor at the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University. ""We're now starting to get a sense that perhaps given the scale we might have more sustained or less-clustered, more efficient human-to-human transmission — and that's really what we're looking out for because that is what tells us whether a disease is going to spread more rapidly between people,"" Phelan told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Thursday. According to the World Health Organization, coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that could cause less-severe diseases such as the common cold, while other could lead to more severe disease such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

Wall Street's big investors and strategists said the virus, which appears to have spread from seafood or meat at a Wuhan food market, has created a new level of uncertainty for global markets, at a time when some investors are concerned about high valuations. They made comparisons to the SARS virus, which was first surfaced in late 2002 in China, for clues on how it might impact the economy and markets. ""We've got a curveball with this coronavirus. I think that's a big deal. If you look at what happened in 2003, estimates ranged 0.5% to 2% in GDP for China, half a percent for Southeast Asia,"" investor Paul Tudor Jones told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""Stock markets sold off double digits. If you look at the escalation of the reported cases, it feels a lot like that."" Stocks traded lower Tuesday afternoon after news that the U.S. had discovered its first case of the coronavirus. Stocks had previously recovered much of their early losses ahead of the report of an ill traveler from China, who was diagnosed in Washington state. Treasury yields moved to lows of the day after the report, and the 10-year touched 1.76%. Yields move opposite price. Oil futures was off about a half percent, after reversing earlier steeper losses, and copper remained under pressure, down 1.8%. Some analysts said while it's still early, the virus does not seem to be as lethal as SARS, which killed about 10% of patients. Chinese authorities on Monday acknowledged that the virus was now being transmitted between humans, creating more concern of a mass epidemic. The coronavirus infection can create respiratory problems, coughing, fever and in more severe cases pneumonia, or acute respiratory syndrome and death. ""For now, we are keeping our economic forecasts for this year unchanged, but the spread of the virus is clearly a major downside risk and we will continue to monitor the situation closely,"" Capital Economics senior economist Gareth Leather wrote. ""If the virus does spread, the worst affected countries are likely to be those most dependent on Chinese tourist spending. In addition to China itself, Hong Kong stands as the most exposed. Thailand and Vietnam are also vulnerable."" There have been about 300 documented cases, mostly in Hubei province. With a population about 11 million, the capital, Wuhan is its largest city. ""So far there have only been six fatalities, mostly apparently of people with pre-existing conditions. Most patients have shown only relatively mild symptoms,"" Leather said. China's severe acute respiratory syndrome killed about 700 people. Leather said the hit to the Chinese economy from the SARS epidemic could have been far greater than the decline in GDP that was reported by China. Some analysts said SARS shaved about 1% from Chinese GDP growth. ""While the authorities in China were initially slow to respond, in the past couple of days they have become much more open about the spread of the virus and proactive in trying to contain it. People in Wuhan found to have flu-like symptoms have been prevented from taking planes or trains out of the city, while tour groups have also reportedly been banned from leaving the city,"" Leather noted. ""Other countries have also been taking precautions such as screening people at airports and isolating people suspected of having the virus. The contrast with 2003, when China's authorities were heavily criticised for trying to conceal the spread of SARS, is marked."" China's Xinhua News Agency reported that Wuhan is taking preventative measures, like canceling what it considers unnecessary, large gatherings of people. It also is setting up a prevention and control center and improving protection for medical workers, some of whom have already been infected. Sick patients are being quarantined. Stocks of travel-related companies, including airlines and hotel companies fell Tuesday. Cathay Pacific lost 4% on the Hong Kong market, while American Airlines, was down about 2% and United Air Lines lost 3.3%. Casino companies Wynn Resorts was off 4.4% and Las Vegas Sands fell nearly 4%, as investors considered the impact in Macau and elsewhere. Marriott Vacations Worldwide lost 2%, and Marriott International, was off 1.9%. U.S. stocks were trading slightly lower, with the S&P down fractionally, but Hong Kong stocks lost 2.8%; Shanghai fell 1.4% and South Korea was down 1%. ""Psychologically, travel takes a hit when there's fears of a pandemic. We're at the early stages,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. He added that luxury goods also get hit because of expectations that Chinese tourists will cut back. LVMH Moet Hennessy was off 2.3% in U.S. trading. Cruise ship companies also fell, with Royal Caribbean Cruises off 4.6%. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF was down 4%, and iShares MSCI China ETF was off 3.3% in U.S. trading. ""I don't want to be complacent because you don't know. Investors often react to the possibility of disaster rather than disaster itself,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. ""It's the possibility that things could get worse that's causing some of those moves, not the current reality. … It's fair to say that China, because they've had a few of these events in the past, has gotten better at containing them."" The health scare comes as some investors see the recent trade agreement between the U.S. and China as a catalyst for better global growth this year. ""As an investor, I'm not planning on making any changes to the portfolio today. We, of course, will monitor the situation, as we always do,"" said Keon. ""It looks like the global economy is bottoming to us, and maybe will grow a little faster in the second half of the year. The U.S. economy is the same story. Though valuations are not cheap, but given some positive news on geopolitics ... I think you don't make any changes today, but you have to keep your head up."" The concern about the outbreak was intensified because it comes just ahead of the Lunar New Year, when millions of Chinese citizens travel for the holiday. The virus has also been found in other countries, including Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, which reported one case each, and Thailand, which reported two cases. ""There's no vaccination. There's no cure. We don't even know what the incubation period is,"" said Jones, who is founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment. ""We kind of know how lethal it is. It seems a little bit less than what SARS was. ... If I was an investor, I'd be really nervous."" The World Health Organization will hold a meeting Wednesday to consider whether the outbreak should be declared an international public health emergency. ""The speed and scale of the spread of the virus comes ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year when millions of Chinese travel on the mainland back to their home towns. The major point is whether the virus turns from an outbreak to an epidemic. Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, with only six (the latest would make it seven) strains known to infect humans — its mildest is the common cold while SARs is the most deadly,"" notes Jefferies Asian analysts. The analysts also said the virus is believed to be less serious than SARS, but it may be difficult to know how many cases there actually are. ""The under-reporting of the coronavirus on the mainland has made it difficult to gauge the spread of the disease but the admission by President Xi Jinping that the authorities needed to control the pneumonia-like disease alongside the first cases of human-to-human transmission and international cases meant that the outbreak required a much more aggressive containment strategy. One major point is that the number of cases may be under-reported because in cases of youths the symptoms might not necessarily be that debilitating,"" the analysts noted. UBS analysts said investors are currently reacting the way they did in the SARS outbreak. ""We believe the downward trend is temporary (until maybe end of the spring, if negative news continues),"" they noted. ""Unlike the SARS break-out in 2003, the Wuhan pneumonia has been quickly identified and large-scale preventive efforts are underway across China (and other countries as well). However, there is risk that contagion may peak in the March/April timeframe which could weigh on the stocks (especially if negative information continues to fill news channels)."" They expect slower passenger growth for Chinese airlines, with growth this year of 4% rather than 9%. ""We do see the Chinese government being more transparent in communicating with the public and Chinese hospitals much more experienced in handling contagious diseases. Based on the information we have, we think Wuhan Pneumonia does not seem to be as severe as SARS and is much better controlled,"" the UBS analysts wrote. —CNBC's Michael Bloom and Yun Li contributed to this report",finance,

41,41,China coronavirus: What we know about the outbreak,2020-01-21,Weizhen Tan@weizent,cnbc,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/21/china-coronavirus-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-outbreak-from-wuhan.html," The outbreak of a new coronavirus stemming from Wuhan, China, has killed nine people and afflicted more than 400 others ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday during which hundreds of millions of people are expected to travel. As of Wednesday morning, it has now spread beyond Asia, with one confirmed case found in Washington State, U.S. Officials confirmed that the new mystery virus can spread between humans and said 15 medical staff have now been infected, stoking fears about an international pandemic and prompting airport authorities around the world to step up screening of travelers arriving from China. The outbreak could hit the economy, experts warned as they pointed to the fallout from the deadly SARS crisis in 2003. The coronavirus, which causes a type of pneumonia, was thought to have originated at a wholesale seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. It was first reported in late December. The World Health Organization said it appears the outbreak began in an animal source.  On Sunday, China's National Health Commission said the source of the virus remains unknown and that its transmission path hasn't been completely traced. Symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, and there is no vaccine for this new virus yet. As of Tuesday evening, authorities have confirmed more than 400 cases, with most of those occurring in the Hubei province of China and its provincial capital of Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. The outbreak was also spreading to other cities, with 14 cases in southern province of Guangdong, five in the capital Beijing, five in the eastern province of Zhejiang, two in Shanghai and two in Tianjin City. Cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea and Japan. Taiwan confirmed its first case Tuesday evening in a 55-year-old Taiwanese woman who had returned from Wuhan the night before. On Tuesday, the WHO warned the coronavirus was likely to spread. ""More cases should be expected in other parts of China and possibly other countries in the coming days,"" said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic. Asked by Reuters why the WHO expected higher numbers, Jasarevic said new cases would appear as China steps up monitoring. The outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday period this week, when millions of Chinese will travel domestically and overseas — heightening the risk of more transmissions. The WHO, which does not advise travel restrictions at this time, said it will convene an emergency committee on the virus on Wednesday to consider declaring an international health emergency.  The outbreak has sparked alarm because the disease is in the same family of viruses as severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS, which emerged in China in 2002 and was identified in 2003, killed nearly 800 people worldwide. It hit Asian cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei and Beijing the hardest and triggered a severe downturn in the region. ""I remember the SARS outbreak very, very clearly and the impact it had. These things have an enormous hit on economies,"" said Rob Carnell, Dutch bank ING's chief economist, adding that some countries even slipped into recession. ""It is not inconceivable that if Wuhan becomes more widely spread, and starts to claim more lives, that it will result in a similar response,"" added Carnell. At the time, the rapid spread of SARS was blamed on a lack of transparency by the Chinese authorities. In an opinion editorial published Sunday, state tabloid Global Times wrote, ""In the early moments of SARS, there was concealment in China. This must not be repeated."" This time, however, experts say China has moved more rapidly to deal with the crisis and that the virus appears to be less lethal than SARS. Chinese President Xi Jinping said Monday that containing the spread of the coronavirus should be a ""top priority,"" according to state media. ""Government and World Health Organization reports indicate that the virus is both less virulent and less deadly than SARS. The response from Beijing is also far faster this time than it was in 2002-04,"" said Rory Green, economist for China and South Korea at research firm TS Lombard. Carnell warned that if consumers get spooked, the impact on the economy could be significant. ""Things like this ... stop people from undertaking economic activity. You don't go out. You don't travel. You don't eat out,"" he warned. ""You don't even need lots of people to die or even get sick. You just need people to be worried about that to have a very very massive impact, and potentially quite a long-lasting impact."" He pointed to SARS as an example: Tourists stopped traveling to places where there were outbreaks, commuters stopped taking public transport and worked from home instead, and consumers stayed away from malls and restaurants. At the peak of SARS, Green noted, domestic tourist growth in the second quarter of 2003 fell 45% year on year, and revenue from that activity plunged 64%. He said, however, that the impact this time should be less than that of SARS, given that it seems to be less virulent. ""Given the Wuhan coronavirus is less serious and the government response has been faster and stronger, the impact on the economy will certainly be less than SARS,"" he said. ""At present our outlook is for the disease to drag on retail sales and tourism but for consumption growth to remain on trend at 7%."" —Reuters contributed to this report.",finance,

Morgan Stanley — Shares of the nation's fourth-largest bank sunk 2.8% following a downgrade from Citigroup to neutral from buy. The firm said the stock is fairly valued and there isn't enough upside to justify a buy rating given Morgan Stanley's recent outperformance, spurred by earnings. Beyond Meat — Alternative meat company Beyond Meat's stock jumped 18.4% after Starbucks announced plans to add more plant-based items to its menu. Shares of Beyond Meat also soared after McDonald's announced it will test plant-based burgers in Canada. Tesla — Shares of the electric automaker gained 7.2% after New Street Research raised its target on the stock to $800 and reiterated its buy rating. The firm said that demand for the vehicles is strong, and that management is executing. Tesla shares have more than doubled over the last three months. Uber — Shares of the ride-hailing app jumped 7% after the company said it sold its Eats business in India to competitor Zomato, an Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up. The sale gives Uber a 9.99% stake in the business. Uber was also named Morgan Stanley's top technology stock pick for 2020 on Tuesday. The firm said Uber's stock can rally 60% this year. Halliburton — Halliburton shares rose more then 1% but closed down 0.8% after the oilfield services company posted better-than-expected quarterly results. The company reported a profit of 32 cents per share on revenue of $5.191 billion. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected earnings of 29 cents per share on sales of $5.103 billion. CEO Jeff Miller cited growth in Halliburton's international business as a strong point in the quarter. Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands — Shares of Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands fell 6.1% and 5.4%, respectively, amid fears that the coronavirus outbreak in China would weaken international travel.

43,43,CDC announces first US case of coronavirus that killed 17 in China,2020-01-21,Berkeley Lovelace Jr.@BerkeleyJr,cnbc,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/21/cdc-to-announce-first-us-case-of-china-coronavirus-that-has-killed-6-cnn-reports.html,"Public health officials have confirmed the first U.S. case of a mysterious coronavirus that has sickened hundreds of people in China, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Tuesday. A Snohomish County, Washington State resident who was returning from China on Jan. 15 was diagnosed with the Wuhan coronavirus, according to the CDC. Officials said the patient, a male in his 30s, is ""very healthy."" He is currently being isolated at a medical center in the state ""out of caution"" and ""poses little risk"" to the public, they said. The CDC said the man reached out to local health authorities last week once he started experiencing pneumonia-like symptoms. ""We're being proactive at all levels,"" Nancy Messonnier, CDC's director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. ""CDC will be working closely with the state health department on the particulars of this patient's care."" President Donald Trump on Wednesday told CNBC he was aware of the case and said the U.S. has it ""totally under control."" ""We have it totally under control,"" Trump told ""Squawk Box"" co-host Joe Kernen in an interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""It's one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It's going to be just fine."" On Wednesday, Chinese state television reported that 17 people have died from the illness. Public health officials have confirmed more than 400 cases of the illness, which has evoked memories of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in China. Health officials have also confirmed cases in Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. CDC officials said they continue to believe the risk of it spreading to the American public is ""low."" This weekend, the CDC and Homeland Security began screening people traveling to major airports in California and New York from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak is believed to have started. Health officials said Tuesday they will begin screenings at airports in Chicago and Atlanta. So far, they have screened more than 1,200 passengers. ""We hope over the next couple of days"" the situation ""will become clearer,"" Messonnier said. The World Health Organization is expected to convene a panel of experts in Geneva, Switzerland, on Wednesday to consider whether the illness should be a global health emergency. The last time WHO declared a global health emergency was in 2019 for the Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo that killed more than 2,000 people. The agency also declared global emergencies for the 2016 Zika virus, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu, and the 2014 polio and Ebola outbreaks. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that usually infect animals but can sometimes evolve and spread to humans. Symptoms in humans include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath, which can progress to pneumonia. Chinese authorities say many of the patients with the new illness had come into contact with seafood markets, suggesting the virus is spreading from animals to people. However, health officials say some ""limited human-to-human transmission"" occurred between close contacts. In addition to health concerns, some experts worried about the economic consequences if the new coronavirus evolves into a pandemic. They pointed to the fallout from the deadly SARS crisis in 2003. SARS, which emerged in China in 2002 and was identified in 2003, killed nearly 800 people worldwide. It hit Asian cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, and Beijing the hardest and triggered a severe downturn in the region. Fears that the coronavirus could disrupt travel and commerce, and slow economic growth sent a chill through global risk markets, hitting Asian stocks hard, depressing copper and oil prices, and sending investors into safe havens, like U.S. Treasurys and German bunds. People can protect themselves from the virus by washing their hands with soap and water, avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth and keeping away from sick people, according to the CDC. Many people in China have purchased face masks to protect themselves from the outbreak. —CNBC's Weizhen Tan contributed to this report.",finance,

The meeting comes two days after global health officials said that the respiratory illness, which has evoked memories of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, is capable of spreading from person to person. This weekend, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Homeland Security began screening people traveling to the United States from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak is believed to have started. WHO doesn't enact these emergencies easily, public health officials say. The international health agency has only applied the emergency designation five times since the rules were implemented in the mid-2000s. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that usually infect animals but can sometimes evolve and spread to humans. Symptoms in humans include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, which can progress to pneumonia. Public health officials have confirmed more than 300 cases of the new coronavirus, labeled ""2019-nCoV,"" in China. Some of the patients are critically ill. Health officials have also confirmed cases in Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Chinese authorities say many of the patients with the illness had come into contact with seafood markets, suggesting the virus is spreading from animals to people. However, health officials say some ""limited human-to-human transmission"" occurred between close contacts. Global health officials have not recommended any trade or travel restrictions yet. The CDC, which has deemed the immediate health risk to the American population as ""low,"" is closely monitoring the situation with WHO officials. The CDC is recommending that people traveling to Wuhan, China, should avoid animals, animal markets and sick people. People can protect themselves from the virus by washing their hands with soap and water, avoiding touching their eyes, nose or mouth and keeping away from sick people, according to the CDC. Many people in China have purchased face masks to protect themselves from the outbreak. WHO defines the emergency, also known as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, as an ""extraordinary event"" that is ""serious, unusual or unexpected."" The agency's director-general is responsible for determining whether an event constitutes a global health emergency, after the convening of a committee of top health experts, according to WHO. The committee advises the director-general on how to handle the outbreak and will continue to provide advice throughout the duration of the emergency. Declaring an emergency gives WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus power to issue recommendations, including asking countries not to implement any travel or trade bans. The designation can also prompt outside help to raise money and other assistance. The last time WHO declared a global health emergency was in 2019 for the Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo that has killed more than 2,000 people. The agency also declared global emergencies for the 2016 Zika virus, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu and the 2014 polio and Ebola outbreaks.",finance,

It defies imagination,"" Jones said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""It reminds me a lot of the early '99.

Asked if investors should sell now to avoid a blow-up like the one that took place in March of 2000, Jones said, ""Not really. The train has got a long, long way to go if you think about it."" The legendary hedge fund manager and trader noted that the Nasdaq Composite more than doubled from a similar stage to the dot-com bubble top. ""That's a long way from now. At the top theoretically, rates [would] be substantially higher."" The stock market hit a peak in 2000 before the dot-com bubble burst. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite approached 5,000 in early 2000 then dove thousands of points, crushing investors. Jones, founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment Corporation, warned that the new ""curveball"" to derail the bull market could be the outbreak of the coronavirus. ""That's a big deal.

Chicago-based United is one of three U.S. airlines cancelling more than 1,000 monthly flights in a hit to profits as the 737 MAX remains grounded following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Boeing said on Tuesday it does not expect to win approval for the return of the 737 MAX to service until mid-year, longer than previously forecast. United's adjusted net income rose to $676 million, or $2.67 per share, in the fourth quarter to Dec. 31, from $657 million a year earlier, topping a Wall Street consensus forecast for $2.65 per share. While the airline has warned of a negative hit from the MAX grounding, it did not disclose any estimated financial impact from the fallout and stood by its full-year adjusted EPS range of $11 to $13. Total operating revenue rose to $10.89 billion, boosted by Chief Executive Oscar Munoz's three-year strategy to build up the airline's flight connections through its main U.S. hubs. United President Scott Kirby will replace Munoz as CEO later this year. Major U.S. airlines are benefitting from strong leisure and corporate travel demand, a trend that looked set to continue in the first quarter. Revenue per mile flown, a closely watched industry measurement, rose 0.8% in the fourth quarter and United forecast similar growth in the first quarter. The company had already announced a non-cash impairment charge of $90 million in the fourth quarter related to its Hong Kong routes, following anti-government protests in the city. It did not comment in the earnings release on the potential impact of the Wuhan coronavirus in China, which J.P.Morgan analyst Jamie Baker said poses a near-term overhang for airlines. In a separate statement, United said there is currently no impact on its operations from the outbreak and that it remains in close contact with U.S., Asian and Chinese authorities on safety. United management will host a conference call to discuss results on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EST (1630 GMT). Fellow U.S. MAX operators Southwest Airlines Co and American Airlines Group Inc are due to report quarterly results on Thursday.

Elsewhere, Japan Airlines slipped 2.97% in Japan while ANA shed 2.16%. Australia's Qantas fell 1.7%. In Hong Kong, shares of insurers tumbled as AIA fell 3.42%. Hong Kong-listed shares of Ping An and China Life Insurance also dropped 4.31% and 4.95%, respectively. Stocks of casino operators also fell, with Wynn Macau plunging 4.81% and Melco International Development diving 4.35%. Wynn has a significant exposure to China. Chinese authorities on Tuesday confirmed a fourth death in an ongoing coronavirus outbreak in the country, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to more than 200, Reuters reported. An official has also confirmed that the disease can spread from person-to-person, the report said. Outside China, cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""The biggest risk actually is about the fact that Chinese … New Year is just around the corner, so the number of tourists domestically who will be just travelling within China actually adds to risk about … how widely could this virus spread from people-to-people contact in the shortest span of time than any other time of the year,"" Waqas Adenwala, Asia analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Tuesday. Adenwala said the business impact could extend beyond tourism-related firms such as airlines due to the upcoming festive season. ""You will actually see a lot of impact on people who're running, you know, big retail conglomerates to as well, or FMCGs where you'd actually see a lot of people going in to buy festive products just ahead of the celebrations,"" Adenwala said, referring to fast-moving consumer goods which are typically sold quickly at a low cost. Hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens are expected to travel domestically and internationally during the extended Lunar New Year holiday which starts on Saturday. The annual mass movement of people has ignited fears of a further spread of the virus and kindled memories of the fatal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2002 and 2003. SARS killed 800 people — most of them from China and Hong Kong — during that period, according to data from the World Health Organization. Also caused by a coronavirus, the SARS pandemic cost the global economy tens of billions of dollars. The current situation is ""slightly helped"" by the presence of online commerce today as compared to the time of the SARS outbreak, Adenwala said.

Broader emerging market assets dropped as news of the contagion reminded investors of the economic fallout from the SARS crisis in 2003 that killed nearly 800 people, and led to a recession in Hong Kong. In Latin America, Brazilian stocks fell about 1.4%, their biggest intraday loss since late-November. Iron ore miner Vale was among the largest drags on the Bovespa after documents showed that prosecutors had charged 16 individuals with homicide over a Vale dam burst last year, including the company's then chief executive, Fabio Schvartsman. Brazil's real was slightly softer to the dollar. ""The pace of inflows (to emerging markets) is likely to decelerate this week amid rising concerns about Chinas coronavirus, which reportedly can be passed between humans,"" analysts at Rabobank wrote in a note. MSCI's index for Latin American stocks fell 1.5%, on track to snap a three-day winning streak. MSCI's index for currencies in Latin America dropped 0.3%. The risk averse mood was also backed by global growth fears after the International Monetary Fund trimmed back its global growth forecasts for 2020 and 2021. The reductions reflect the IMF's reassessment of economic prospects for a number of major emerging markets as it marked down growth forecasts for Chile due to social unrest and for Mexico, due to a continued weakness in investment. The Mexican peso and the Chilean peso both retreated against the dollar, while stock markets in the two countries also fell. Argentine stocks dropped more than 3%, while the peso dipped slightly as the country's government sought to push through legislation to help solve a mounting debt crisis. Argentina faces negotiations with creditors including the IMF to restructure about $100 billion in sovereign debt, which President Alberto Fernandez has said the country cannot afford to pay until it revives its stalled economy. Concerns over protectionist politics taking the forefront in Argentina had sparked a crash in the peso last year, as investors fretted over the country's ability to repay its debt obligations.

The Centers for Disease Control said the virus, which originated in China, had been diagnosed in a US resident who arrived in Seattle from China. The virus, which spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected almost 300 people, and six have died. North Korea has temporarily closed its borders to foreign tourists in response to the threat, a tour operator says. The patient diagnosed in the US - reported to be a man in his 30s - returned from Wuhan on 15 January, the CDC said. ""The patient sought care at a medical facility in the state of Washington, where the patient was treated for the illness,"" it added in a statement. ""Based on the patient's travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected this new coronavirus."" Laboratory testing of a clinical specimen confirmed the diagnosis on 20 January, the CDC statement continued. The announcement that North Korea was barring entry to foreign tourists came from Young Pioneer Tours, which is based in China and specialises in travel to North Korea. The company said in a statement that North Korea was implementing a temporary ban as a precaution. ""Further details are yet to be confirmed by our travel partners in North Korea and we will continue to make all future announcements on our website,"" Young Pioneer Tours said. Another tour group that travels to North Korea, Koryo Tours, also tweeted about ""possible limits to tourist entry"". Some experts have previously warned that international sanctions on North Korea had hit the country's healthcare system, by restricting the delivery of aid and medical equipment. Last November, US doctor Kee B Park wrote in USA Today: ""I have seen how the North Korean doctors have adapted to scarcity. For example, they reuse intravenous catheters, scalpels, gauze and gloves by meticulously cleaning and re-sterilising them - until they become unusable."" Earlier on Monday, Chinese officials confirmed for the first time that the virus could pass from person to person. At the same time Chinese state media said six people had died from the infection, which causes a type of pneumonia. A total of 291 cases have now been reported across major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. However, most are in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people at the heart of the outbreak. The disease was first identified there late last year, and the outbreak is believed to be linked to a seafood market that also sells live animals. Aside from the United States, two cases have been identified in Thailand, one in Japan, one in South Korea and one in Taiwan. All those infected had recently returned from Wuhan. Authorities in several countries, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. US authorities last week announced similar measures at airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. They have now announced plans to introduce similar measures at airports in Chicago and Atlanta this week. In Australia, a man who had travelled to Wuhan has been placed in isolation and is undergoing tests. China is the largest source of tourists to Australia, with more than a million Chinese citizens visiting last year. But the measures being put in place by North Korea are the strictest so far. A report by the Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College, London, suggested there could be more than 1,700 infections. However, Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, put the figure closer to 1,300. The virus, known also as 2019-nCoV, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans. Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people. The World Health Organization has advised people to avoid ""unprotected"" contact with live animals, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms. Signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.",general,

Many in China scrambled to buy face masks to protect themselves from the previously unknown, flu-like coronavirus infection and airports around the world tightened screening. The outbreak, which began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, also worried financial markets as investors recalled the economic damage from China's Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002/2003 that it initially covered up. The SARS coronavirus outbreak killed nearly 800 people then. ""We'll stay at home during the holiday. I'm scared as I remember SARS very well,"" said Zhang Xinyuan, who had been bound from Beijing for the Thai resort of Phuket before she and her husband decided to cancel their air tickets. Authorities have confirmed more than 300 cases of the new coronavirus in China, mostly in Wuhan, a provincial capital and transportation hub, where it may have come from a seafood market. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty in breathing, and the viral infection can cause pneumonia. Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang told Chinese state television on Tuesday six people had died in his city. The disease was spreading further around other parts of China, however, including five cases in the national capital Beijing. Fifteen medical personnel are among those infected. Abroad, Thailand has reported two cases and South Korea one, all involving Chinese from Wuhan. Japan and Taiwan also confirmed one case each, both nationals who had been to Wuhan. The World Health Organization (WHO) will hold a meeting on Wednesday to consider whether the outbreak is an international public health emergency. ""Information about newly reported infections suggest there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission,"" said WHO's regional director for the western Pacific, Takeshi Kasai. Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its own, set up an epidemic response centre. More than 1,000 beds were prepared in isolation wards in case the virus spreads further. North Korea was to temporarily ban foreign tourists, who are mainly Chinese, a foreign tour operator said. The scare stirred risk aversion on global markets, with Asia particularly hit. Hong Kong, which suffered badly during the SARS outbreak, saw its index fall 2.8%. Japan's Nikkei lost 0.9% and Shanghai blue chips 1.7%, with airlines under pressure. In Europe, shares of luxury goods makers, which have large exposure to China, were among those declining the most. China's yuan fell almost 0.7% in offshore trading to 6.9126 per dollar. Onshore, it dipped to its lowest in over a week at 6.9094. Though the origin of the virus has yet to be identified, WHO said the primary source was probably animal. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to Wuhan's seafood market. ""The outbreak of a SARS-like coronavirus in Wuhan is developing into a major potential economic risk to the Asia-Pacific region now that there is medical evidence of human-to-human transmission,"" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific Chief Economist for IHS Markit. So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions but they may be discussed on Wednesday. China's National Health Commission is also scheduled to give an update at a press briefing at 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) on Wednesday. Airports in the United States, Australia and across Asia have begun extra screening for passengers from Wuhan. In the city itself, officials have been using infrared thermometers to screen passengers at airports, railway stations and other passenger terminals since Jan. 14. The Lunar New Year is a major holiday for Chinese, many of whom travel to join family or have a foreign holiday. Long lines formed to buy face masks in cities. Some online vendors limited sales of masks and hand sanitizers as demand surged. Shanghai city's market regulator warned it would punish speculators hoarding masks or other products used for preventing infectious diseases, according to the Shanghai Observer web publication. Chinese travel booking platforms from Trip.com to Alibaba Group's Fliggy said they would offer free cancellations on bookings made for Wuhan, while South Korean budget airline T'way Air postponed its launch of a new route to the city. Zhong Nanshan, head of the National Health Commission's team investigating the outbreak, sought to ease alarm, saying in footage shown by state television there was no danger of a repeat of the SARS epidemic so long as precautions were taken. South Korean budget airline T'way Air has postponed Tuesday's scheduled launch of a new route to the Chinese city of Wuhan because of rising concern over the spread of a new coronavirus, a company official said. On Monday South Korea reported its first confirmed case of the virus from a 35-year-old Chinese national who flew from Wuhan to Seoul on Sunday. T'way had been set for the first of its twice-a-week flights from the South Korean main hub of Incheon to Wuhan at 1020 p.m. (1320 GMT) but canceled its plans because of the outbreak, the company official said. ""It was an inevitable decision because of the situation there,"" the official told Reuters, adding that it would continue to monitor developments. The move came amid spiraling fears over the virus, which could be spread through human contact, with millions of Asians traveling for the Lunar New Year holiday this week. In China, the number of confirmed cases rose to 291 on Monday. An official at Korean Air Lines, the only other South Korean airline operating direct flights to Wuhan, said the company had no plans to suspend its route, which operates four times a week, but will waive ticket cancellation fees for passengers traveling to the city. South Korea's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday warned tourists against contact with animals and people showing respiratory symptoms and market visits in China. President Moon Jae-in instructed local authorities to step up prevention efforts, with many South Koreans living in China expected to return home and some 32 million traveling around the country for the holiday until next week.",finance,

The ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed economic sentiment among investors rose to 26.7 from 10.7 in December. Economists had expected an increase to 15.0. The result suggested investors believe the German economy might not be hurt as badly by trade tensions as previously thought. A separate measurement of how investors assess the economy's current conditions improved to -9.5 from -19.9 in the previous month. Analysts had forecast a reading of -13.5. The 10-year German government bond yield was last flat at -0.248%. Earlier, it had hit a two-week trough, falling as low as -0.256%. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also fell by an even larger extent to 1.766%, their lowest since Jan. 8, trading last down 6 bps at 1.778%. Yields across other euro zone economies were stable. Investors said the yield had been pushed lower by reports of an outbreak of the coronavirus in China, where the death toll rose to six and authorities reported a surge in new cases. The virus ""may weigh on China's economic activity and consumer spending,"" which in turn may weigh on global growth, said Rainer Guntermann, a rates strategist at Commerzbank. Weaker growth in the world's second largest economy would steer investors from taking more bets and being more active in the financial markets. The German surveys follow a pick-up in data releases in recent weeks, which has prompted economists to conclude that euro zone economic activity has probably bottomed out. ""If you look at the nature of it, I'm not sure this should give some additional information that is beyond the consensus of the investor community,"" said ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""This is not something like the Ifo that is purely rooted in the business community, which is giving us additional information,"" he said, referring to another closely followed German survey, based on data from around 9,000 firms across various sectors.

Market players across the globe were spooked after China reported a fourth death from the flu-like virus on Tuesday as the number of cases continued to rise and China confirmed the new virus could be spread through human contact. A basket of emerging market stocks fell 1.3%, putting it on course for its biggest one-day percentage decline in nearly five months. ""The headlines around the virus outbreak in China is the one factor that has been affecting the larger equity market bulls today, particularly more for stocks than currencies,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London. China's stocks fell to two-week lows, leading losses among Asian equity markets, while the onshore Chinese yuan also slipped. MSCI's index of emerging market currencies shed 0.5%, with the South African rand leading declines. The currency touched its lowest level since Dec. 12, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday lowered its growth forecasts for the South African economy in 2020 and 2021, citing structural constraints and deteriorating public finances. ""Fiscal possession in South Africa looks particularly fragile especially after the government started to make upward revisions to debt projections late last year,"" Jackson said.

57,57,China is trying to stop the spread of new coronavirus at worst possible time of year - CNN,2020-01-21,"Nectar Gan, CNN",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/20/health/china-wuhan-coronavirus-lunar-new-year-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) Governments around the world have always struggled to stop the spread of disease, from the deadly swine flu which struck the globe in 2009, to ongoing attempts to rein in Ebola in West Africa . No health authority has ever tackled the challenge currently faced by China , however, as the country grapples with a new coronavirus just as hundreds of millions prepare to travel during the Lunar New Year period -- the largest annual human migration on Earth. During the Lunar holiday, people from across the country will cram themselves into homebound trains, buses and planes for family reunions. Others will take advantage of the time off to holiday overseas. Last year, close to 7 million Chinese tourists traveled abroad for Lunar New Year, according to state media. The holiday -- the most important in the Chinese calendar -- comes at the worst possible time for health authorities racing to contain the outbreak which has put the rest of Asia on alert. Medical staff members carry a patient into Wuhan's Jinyintan hospital, where patients infected by the Wuhan coronavirus are being treated, on January 18, 2020. The virus, which was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, is known to have infected more than 300 people and spread to at least three other countries already. On Monday, China's National Health Commission confirmed that the Wuhan coronavirus can be passed from human-to-human and that medical staff had also been infected. Read More The spread of the mysterious respiratory virus to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States , is fueling fears of a broader epidemic, as China enters its busiest travel period of the year. ""One of the consequences of a more connected world is that outbreaks have the potential to spread internationally much more rapidly than was the case 50 years ago,"" said Mike Turner, director of science at the Wellcome Trust, a UK-based global health charity. More cases have also been reported within China, evidence that the outbreak has spread well beyond Wuhan, creating a risk of unpredictable further infection. As of Tuesday morning, five cases have been confirmed in Beijing, two in Shanghai, and 14 in the southern province of Guangdong -- all hundreds of miles from Wuhan. Additional suspected cases have been reported across the country, from eastern Shandong province to Sichuan province in the southwest. Chinese scientists on January 8 identified the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus , the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In 2002 and 2003, SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia, spreading as far as Canada. During a news conference Monday, Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese government-appointed expert who helped discover the SARS coronavirus, said the infectiousness of the new Wuhan coronavirus was not as strong as SARS, but that the disease was ""climbing"" and suggested that the ""death rate at the moment is not so representative."" Since December, four people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus have died. 6 people dead, almost 300 infected as China confirms Wuhan virus can be spread by humans Uncertainties about the Wuhan coronavirus -- including its unidentified source -- have prompted fears there may be more people infected than currently reported. Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease expert who heads the Wellcome Trust, said the outbreak is ""extremely concerning."" ""It is possible that often mild symptoms, and probability of people being affected and infectious without experiencing symptoms, from this coronavirus may be masking the true numbers of people who have been infected, and the extent of person to person transmission,"" said Farrar. Initial symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus include fever and coughing -- which are also common flu symptoms, a viral infection prevalent in the winter months. Some patients infected with the coronavirus also have difficulty breathing and invasive lesions on the lungs, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO will convene an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the outbreak in China. Transportation hub The recent spike in confirmed Wuhan coronavirus cases appears to point to a wider area of contamination. According to a recent study by Imperial College London, the number of infections in Wuhan itself are likely a gross underestimation, raising the risk that carriers of the virus may have already traveled elsewhere within China before screening measures were put in place. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday that since the outbreak, China has been taking active measures to handle the epidemic and formulate prevention and control plans. China's National Health Commission said Sunday that the situation of the outbreak is ""still preventable and controllable."" The more than 200 cases officially confirmed in China is a far cry from the 1,700 the British researchers estimate to have been infected by January 12. The UK team based their calculations on the number of cases reported already in Thailand and Japan, and the estimated number of people departing Wuhan's international airport. Coronavirus explained: What you need to know More than 60 routes connect Wuhan with other countries, including direct flights to New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Paris and London, as well as over a hundred internal flights to other major Chinese cities. The central city of 11 million people is also a hub for the country's high-speed rail network. Governments around the world have begun responding to the perceived threat. On Tuesday, Australia said it is adding border measures for flights from Wuhan to Sydney. The US also announced screening measures for passengers arriving from Wuhan at airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles last week, following similar measures taken by governments in Asia. In Wuhan itself, infrared thermometers have been installed at the airport, train stations, coach terminals and passenger piers to measure the temperatures of passengers departing the city since January 14, according to state media. Those measures were only put in place five weeks after the initial outbreak, meaning countless passengers have left the city without undergoing any screening. Nor is it clear that the screening or heightened attention in Wuhan is working: the woman diagnosed with the coronavirus in South Korea had visited a doctor in the city after developing a fever and muscle pains. She was prescribed cold medicine and sent on her way. This photo taken on February 10, 2018 shows passengers travelling on a crowded train during the 26-hour journey from Beijing to Chengdu, as they head home ahead of the Lunar New Year. Cover-up concerns The legacy of SARS hangs long over the current outbreak. During that pandemic, the Chinese government was initially slow to release information, censoring news and downplaying the severity of the outbreak. The lack of transparency sparked backlash at home and drew heavy criticism from foreign governments and the WHO. In April 2003, a prominent doctor in Beijing went on the record to accuse the government of a coverup. Later in the month, China sacked its health minister and the mayor of Beijing over their mishandling of the outbreak. This time around, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission declared the outbreak on December 31, three weeks after the first patient developed symptoms. Chinese scientists identified the pathogen a week later and shared the genome sequence of the virus with the WHO -- a speedy response that earned praise from the WHO and scientists around the world. The Wuhan health commission has also been posting frequent -- and now daily -- updates on the latest infection numbers on its website, but that has failed to allay fears over the disease spreading. The Wuhan health commission announced Monday that 136 new cases had been diagnosed on Saturday and Sunday, including one death. The number was a significant jump from the 62 reported during the weekend, but far short of the estimate by the Imperial College London researchers. The WHO said the spike in reported cases was the result of ""increased searching and testing"" of the virus among people with respiratory illness. JUST WATCHED This may explain the spread of China's new virus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH This may explain the spread of China's new virus 03:38 Before this weekend, Wuhan authorities had maintained for two weeks that no new cases had been detected since January 3. Even as cases were confirmed overseas, there was a complete lack of information on potential infections elsewhere in China, leading to a growing sense of unease and accusations of a coverup by local or national authorities. On Weibo, a Twitter-like social media service, many people questioned the silence from the provincial authorities in particular, pointing out the unlikeliness that only those people who left the country were found to be carrying the virus. ""Does it mean that Wuhan residents only travel abroad but not to other (Chinese) cities?"" one user asked in a popular post. Increased concerns around person-to-person transmission, combined with the mass travel expected in the coming weeks, will have health authorities -- and the public -- on edge to see just how far the new virus spreads. On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping instructed authorities to take ""resolute efforts"" to contain the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, the first time the country's leader has publicly spoken on the outbreak. According to a statement carried on state news agency Xinhua, Xi ""stressed putting people's safety and health as the top priority"" and urged relevant departments to release information promptly and deepen international cooperation.",general,

The coronavirus has already sickened hundreds and killed six people in Asia. CDC officials said the United States will be more strict about health screenings of airplane passengers arriving from Wuhan. The patient, who is not being named, is in isolation at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington. He is in his 30s and lives in Snohomish County, Washington, just north of Seattle. He had recently returned from Wuhan. Coronavirus explained: What you need to know Read More He arrived at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on January 15, before any health screenings for the Wuhan coronavirus began at US airports. He sought medical care on January 19. The CDC and Washington state are now tracing the people he was in contact with to see if he might have spread the disease to someone else. ""We believe the risk to the public is low,"" said John Wiesman, secretary of health for the state of Washington. The patient became ill four days after arriving in the United States and sought care. Based on the patient's symptoms and travel history, doctors suspected the novel Wuhan coronavirus and sent specimens to the CDC in Atlanta, where tests Monday confirmed the virus. The patient is faring well but is still being kept in isolation out of an abundance of caution, health officials said. Health screenings at more US airports Soon, passengers from Wuhan to the United States, whether on direct or indirect flights, will only be allowed to land at one of the five US airports doing health screenings. Screenings include a temperature check and observation for symptoms such as a cough and trouble breathing. China is trying to stop the spread of a deadly new virus at the worst possible time of year Last weekend, the CDC started health screenings for Wuhan passengers arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Los Angeles International Airport and San Francisco International Airport. Starting this week, Wuhan passengers will also be screened at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Chicago O'Hare International Airport. The CDC raised its travel notice for Wuhan, China, from level 1 to level 2 of three possible levels, according to its website . As of Tuesday afternoon, the agency advised travelers to ""practice enhanced precautions."" The highest level, ""Warning - Level 3,"" advises travelers to ""avoid nonessential travel."" Person-to-person transmission of Wuhan virus The Wuhan coronavirus is in the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS , which killed more than 700 people in 2002 and 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. To date, the Wuhan coronavirus has infected more than 300 people and killed six in an outbreak that has struck China, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and now the US. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

The CDC activates this system on a temporary basis to centralize how the agency monitors, prepares for and responds to public health threats. The outbreak started in late December at an animal market in Wuhan, about 700 miles south of Beijing. The virus can jump from animals to people. While there's much to learn about how easily the virus can be transmitted human-to-human, health officials said it appears that it's not spread as easily as some other viruses.

With the economic damage done by the devastating 2003 Sars virus still fresh in the mind of many traders, stocks were sold heavily on Tuesday and expectations grew that the markets were in for more falls in the days ahead. The fears across the region were particularly acute given the threat of contagion as hundreds of millions travel for the forthcoming lunar new year holidays when up to 400 million are expected to be on the move across China. The mood swing saw MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slip 1% after a steady start. Hong Kong, which suffered badly during the Sars outbreak, saw its index fall 2%. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.8% and Shanghai blue chips 1.5%, with airlines under pressure. The caution spread to futures for the S&P 500 on Wall Street which eased 0.4%, while the FTSE100 is seen falling 0.5% at the opening on Tuesday.

The death toll rose to four on Tuesday after an 89-year-old man died from the virus in the central city of Wuhan, which is believed to be the epicentre of the outbreak. China confirmed 291 cases of infected patients in an update on Tuesday. There have also been reports of cases in Thailand, South Korea and Japan. Philippine health authorities said on Tuesday that they were investigating the case of a five-year old Chinese boy with a travel history to Wuhan after he showed flu-like symptoms before arriving in the country. The Sars outbreak claimed the lives of at least 650 people in China and Hong ong in 2002-03 and caused lasting economic damage and disruption. The impact on the Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was not helped on Tuesday after Moody’s said it had lowered its rating in a fresh blow to the financial hub, which is expected to have fallen into recession last year owing to the unrest as well as the China-US trade war. Investors had already been guarded after the International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts, mostly due to a surprisingly sharp slowdown in India and other emerging markets. There had been some relief as Donald Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron seemed to have struck a truce over a proposed digital tax. The two agreed to hold off on a potential tariffs war until the end of the year, a French diplomatic source said. Trump is due to deliver a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos later on Tuesday, and trade and tariffs could be on the agenda. In a tweet late on Monday, Trump said he would be bringing “additional Hundreds of Billions of Dollars back to the United States of America! We are now NUMBER ONE in the Universe, by FAR!!” Heading to Davos, Switzerland, to meet with World and Business Leaders and bring Good Policy and additional Hundreds of Billions of Dollars back to the United States of America! We are now NUMBER ONE in the Universe, by FAR!! The Bank of Japan cited lessened trade risks when nudging up forecasts for economic growth after holding a policy meeting on Tuesday. As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its short-term interest rate target at -0.1% and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around 0%, by a 7-2 vote. Japan’s yen picked up a bid on the safe-haven move and the dollar dipped to 109.92 from an early 110.17. It also gained on the euro, leaving the single currency flat on the dollar at $1.1092. Against a basket of currencies, the US dollar was steady at 97.599, just off a four-week high of 97.729. The Australia dollar took a knock from the flu worries since it attracts large numbers of Chinese tourists, who tend to be big spenders over the lunar new year holidays. A man was in isolation in Brisbane after complaining of flu-like symptoms following a trip to Wuhan. Australia said it would step up screening of some flights from Wuhan. The outbreak was particularly badly timed as the tourism industry has been mauled already by bushfires sweeping the country. Spot gold edged up to $1,566.71 per ounce, and back toward a seven-year peak of $1,610.90 reached last week. Oil prices hesitated, having earlier gained on the risk of supply disruption in Libya.

In a Tuesday press conference, a CDC spokesman said a US citizen returning from a trip to central China had been diagnosed in Seattle. According to the CDC, the man is in his 30s and is in good condition at a hospital in Everett, Washington after returning to the area last week. While in China, the man traveled to the Wuhan area, where the virus is believed to originate. It has since spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai. The US is the fifth country to report a case of the illness. Nearly 300 cases have been reported in China, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. US authorities have begun screening air passengers coming from central China. It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as: Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days.

Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 84,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus. Last month, health officials began reporting new cases of viral pneumonia, including symptoms of fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Officials connected the patients to a food market in Wuhan. So far there are six reported deaths, all in China. Most were 60 or older and had a previous medical condition. Although the virus likely originated from animal-to-people contact, Chinese officials this week confirmed their first case of person-to-person contraction. CDC officials said the risk to the American public is low.

China was blamed for making the 2003 Sars outbreak far worse by initially hiding information and blocking the work of the World Health Organization. This time, leader Xi Jinping has called for tough measures and said “party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people’s lives and health first.” At the airport in Wuhan, the temperatures of departing passengers were checked and outbound tour groups were banned from leaving the city. Virtually everyone in a public role, from traffic police officers to bank tellers, is wearing a protective face mask. One case of new virus has been detected in Japan. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has urged officials to step up quarantine checks at airports and other entry points and visitors arriving from Wuhan, China will be required to fill in health forms. Authorities have tracked down and are monitoring 41 people who had contact with one confirmed case. None of them have developed a fever, tight chest or other initial symptoms of the new virus. Along with stepped-up surveillance, additional cleaning and disinfection measures have been ordered for planes and trains from Wuhan as well as for train stations and the airport. Authorities are ready for a worst-case scenario and are on extremely high alert. As in much of mainland China, Hong Kong residents favour traditional markets where live poultry and other animals are sold. The government health department has advised people against visiting such markets or touching animals or their droppings. Screening for the coronavirus has started at three airports for flights from Wuhan: New York’s John F Kennedy; and San Francisco and Los Angeles international airports. The Center for Disease Control has developed a test to detect the new coronavirus and plans to share the tool with domestic and international partners.

At Incheon airport near Seoul, the only airport in South Korea with direct flights from Wuhan, authorities have been operating two special gates for passengers from the city since 3 January where officials use ear thermometers to check passengers’ temperatures. Handrails of moving walkways and escalators, elevator buttons and doors, drinking fountains and other sensitive areas are also wiped with disinfectant twice a day. Nigeria, China’s top trading partner in Africa, has asked that travellers from Wuhan report to a medical facility if they feel ill and health authorities at points of entry are on alert for cases of coronavirus. India announced on Tuesday that it will expand thermal screening of passengers arriving from China, including Hong Kong, to seven airports from the current three. In-flight announcements before arrival will direct passengers with a fever or cough who have traveled to Wuhan in the previous 14 days to declare themselves to health authorities. Thermal screening will begin in Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin, and continue in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. Singapore will expand temperature screening at Changi airport, one of Asia’s busiest travel hubs, for all travellers on flights arriving from China beginning on Wednesday. The health ministry said individuals with pneumonia and a history of travel to Wuhan within 14 days of the onset of symptoms will be isolated in a hospital as a precautionary measure and investigated. Malaysia has also beefed up screening at Kuala Lumpur international airport. Civil aviation authorities have ordered airport managers to start screening incoming passengers from China, looking for fevers, coughs, breathing difficulties and sore throats. Biosecurity staff and state health officials in New South Wales are meeting flights from Wuhan and are distributing pamphlets printed in English and Chinese to all passengers. The pamphlets describe symptoms of infection and ask people to identify themselves if they are experiencing any.

Local authorities in the central China city of Wuhan have delayed the city's 2020 Lunar New Year celebration set to begin Saturday, amid fears that a pneumonia-causing virus is spreading through the city. The decision Tuesday by Trip.com ( TCOM ) , also known as Ctrip, is one of the first signs of China's travel industry starting to respond to the new coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan and has killed at least six people and sickened hundreds . Worries about a possible epidemic have been amplified because the outbreak coincides with the Lunar New Year holiday , when millions of people are expected to travel within China and to other regions in Asia. Trip.com said it would offer customers free cancellation on all hotels, car rentals and tickets for tourist attractions in Wuhan until January 31. If a hotel refuses to refund the booking fee, Trip.com said it will pay back travelers out of its own pocket. Read More Anyone who has been infected by the virus, or those who have been quarantined or sent back to their place of departure — regardless of where they are located — are also eligible for Trip.com's free cancellation policy. Their travel companions qualify, too. 4 people dead as China confirms Wuhan coronavirus can be spread by humans The company also said it will try to ""coordinate"" with airlines and other companies regarding cancellation requests. At least one Chinese state media outlet, the China Youth Daily, has suggested that the nation's railways and airlines waive cancellation fees to help ""contain the spread of the disease."" Fliggy and Qunar.com, two smaller agencies, announced similar policies Tuesday. Tianjin Airlines and Hainan Airlines, which are both owned by HNA Group, have said that they would allow people to change or cancel their flights to Wuhan if they have been quarantined because they show signs of sickness. Those people can do so without penalties until February 29. Concerns about the virus reached new heights Tuesday after China confirmed that the disease can be transmitted between humans. Earlier this month, Chinese scientists identified the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus, the same family as the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia and spread as far as Canada nearly two decades ago. Market analysts and economists have suggested that the new coronavirus could become a major risk for the region should it continue to spread. Rajiv Biswas, IHS Markit's chief economist for Asia Pacific, pointed out that China's international tourism has boomed since the SARS outbreak, making the risk that a SARS-like virus could spread globally even more severe. Asian markets were broadly lower Tuesday. The ""sea of red"" in Asian markets on Tuesday highlights ""if nothing else, that the global economy has precious spare capacity to absorb unexpected crises,"" wrote Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at Oanda, in a research note Tuesday.

64,64,'Live animals are the largest source of infection': dangers of the export trade | Environment | The Guardian,2020-01-21,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mattha-busby,theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/21/live-animals-are-the-largest-source-of-infection-dangers-of-the-export-trade,"The growth of the live animal export trade will make the spread of diseases more likely, experts have warned. Almost 30% more pigs, goats, cows and sheep were shipped, flown and driven across the world in 2017 than a decade earlier, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. The figure is set to rise further, partly because it is still often cheaper to move live animals than use refrigerated transport, despite advances in technology. Consumer demand for fresh meat is also rising as the global population approaches 8 billion, including many who are increasingly adopting diets rich in meat. But transporting live animals around the world increases the risk of disease transmission, according to veterinarians and epidemiologists who fear the growing industry may have already caused viruses to spread. This week the Guardian’s Animals Farmed series is focusing on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has quadrupled over the last fifty years. Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries on journeys that can take weeks. Every day at least 5 million creatures are in transit, in a secretive global trade in live farm animals. And those numbers are just the cross-border journeys. They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down. We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of this global trade. Jeroen Dewulf, a veterinarian at Ghent University in Belgium, said the introduction of the African swine fever virus (ASF) into Belgium had almost certainly been caused by human interference: either through imported contaminated animal products or by illegal movements of wild boar. “There are several drivers of spreading diseases, but live animals are the largest source of infection,” Dewulf said. “The more you are going to move animals, the more you run the risk that diseases will be spread through these animals. There are other routes, the virus can be transmitted in meat products for example, but it’s much more efficient to transmit via live animals.” David McIver, a senior scientist and epidemiologist at biotech company Metabiota, said the rise in live animal exports was a growing issue for many other diseases, such as avian influenza virus, mad cow disease and Nipah virus, while he warned that ASF could one day feasibly threaten humans in some form. “The first case of Nipah virus in 1998 came after an outbreak in Malaysia following the expansion of pig farming in pristine rainforest areas,” he said. “Bats were eating fruit, they dropped it with their saliva on it, it was eaten by pigs, then it gets into humans and there were 105 deaths. Tons of swine had to be culled to get the outbreak under control. If we’re exporting those animals around the world we’re potentially moving unknown pathogens to new places.” In another well-known case, British live cattle exports, as well as those of beef products, were banned in the 1990s due to the fear of spreading bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease. It is believed that variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare, fatal brain disorder, is likely to be caused by people ingesting meat contaminated with mad cow disease. The authors of a study in journal BioMed warned in 2015: “Animal trade is an effective way of introducing, maintaining and spreading animal diseases, as observed with the spread of different strains of foot and mouth disease in Africa, the Middle East and Asia and the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), for example, into Oman and Canada through the importation of infected cattle.” McIver added: “Even though ASF doesn’t affect humans now, pigs and people are not so different biologically and immunologically, so it is conceivable that a few small changes in the genetics of the virus can allow that to hop into people and then we’ve got ourselves a serious problem.” Prof Dirk Pfeiffer, from City University in Hong Kong and the Royal Veterinary College in London, said the risk depends on where you are in the world. “It’s very regulated in high-income countries with fairly effective measures in place protecting their livestock populations from spread of infectious diseases,” he said. “The real issue is in many of the low- to medium-income countries where there are new opportunities for money to be made, and that includes increased meat demand. Movements of live animals in these parts of the world play a role in spreading animal disease.” In China, for example, live animals are regularly moved around the country in order to supply the ‘wet markets’ where butchers serve up freshly slaughtered meat. These places have long been connected with disease risk – and, indeed, the recent outbreak of coronavirus has been traced back to a wet market in Wuhan. One of the perverse incentives of the surveillance system is the harder you research the more likely you’ll find something A system managed by the World Organisation for Animal Health monitors disease outbreaks and provides information based on the reporting of affected countries. While it is praised for its role, it has to rely on prompt and honest reporting from states to be fully effective. “One of the perverse incentives about the surveillance system is that the harder you research the more likely you’ll find something, and then the country will be a victim of finding something,” Dewulf said. “In Belgium, for example, with the recent ASF outbreak, we were carefully monitoring, we notified all the responsible agencies, and then we faced all the consequences, such as trade restrictions, etc. In consequence, our animal industry has been hit very hard.” But despite the growing realisation of the need to control exports more robustly, experts warn that it would be impossible to screen all animals. “In most cases where we look at the transmission of disease, whether in humans or livestock, we tend to see them move quicker and in more diverse ways than our surveillance systems are able to keep up with,” McIver said. Nor are these systems designed to screen live animals or meat products entering or leaving countries, he said, before warning of diseases which have not yet been identified. “Due to the sheer volume of animals that move around, the budgets that are allocated towards it are not always sufficient and in many cases we’re only able to look for things we know about. Animals may be coming or going with pathogens that are potentially really dangerous but we just haven’t dealt with them yet.” • This article was amended on 22 January 2020 to make clear that it is specifically variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) that is linked to people consuming meat contaminated with mad cow disease.

65,65,How quickly does the Wuhan virus spread?,2020-01-21,nature,nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00146-w,"People wearing face masks in Wuhan, China, where the respiratory virus emerged. Credit: STR/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Researchers are scrambling to ascertain how readily a virus that has infected hundreds of people — and killed at least four — in Asia spreads between people. The revelation on Monday that health-care workers have been infected, considered a litmus test for a pathogen’s ability to spread between people, suggests that the pathogen is more contagious than previously thought, they say. The World Health Organization has called a meeting to decide whether to declare the worsening outbreak a public-health emergency. New virus surging in Asia rattles scientists Zhong Nanshan, the respiratory researcher leading the government’s expert panel on the outbreak, confirmed on Monday that the virus is spreading between people. Now, researchers’ most important task is to find out how infectious this virus is in human-to-human transmission, says Dirk Pfeiffer, an epidemiologist at the City University of Hong Kong. That requires more effective case reporting, he says. Authorities also confirmed on Monday that 15 health-care workers have contracted the illness in Wuhan — and one is in a critical condition. Previously, Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization had said there had been some limited cases of human-to-human transmission between family members, but that animals seemed to be the most likely source of the virus. However, the infection of the health-care workers suggests that the virus is more adept at human-to-human transmission than was first thought, says Kirsty Short, a virologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. Because health-care workers are among the first people to come into contact with ill patients, they are also likely to be infected if a pathogen can be transmitted between humans, she says. But at the moment, little information has been released about whether these cases come from a single hospital or multiple facilities, which would help to determine the scale of human transmission. “If they came from the same hospital, treating the same patient, it could suggest that one person infected a large number of people,” says Short. International response Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, has convened a meeting of medical experts on 22 January to decide whether the current outbreak should be declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the agency’s highest level of alarm. If a PHEIC is established, it will mean that the WHO thinks the outbreak could present a public-health risk in countries other than China. This would potentially prompt a coordinated international response, which Short says is crucial for dealing with respiratory viruses that can cross borders. Even if the expert committee does not declare a PHEIC, the WHO will probably issue recommendations for managing the outbreak. China’s national health commission has categorized the virus, a coronavirus related to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), as a Class B infectious disease. The classification gives the central government the power to shut down travel to, from and within a city, and to take other emergency measures that would effectively shut a city down. Government officials have already started controlling people’s entry and exit into Wuhan, where the virus was first detected in December in people who had visited a live-animal market. In the past week, cases have been reported in other Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen; the illness has so far affected close to 300 people in China. There have also been a handful of cases in other countries, such as Thailand, Japan and South Korea. Over the next week, close to 300 million people will be travelling around China for Chinese New Year. “That is very problematic when you have an emerging respiratory virus potentially floating around the population,” says Matthew Frieman, a microbiologist and immunologist at the University of Maryland. In the month since the outbreak emerged, Chinese authorities have been efficient at identifying cases, sequencing the genome of the pathogen and releasing it to the scientific community, says Frieman. “The rest of this outbreak will really be determined by the speed at which they’re open with information.”",science,
66,66,The US has its first case of the new Wuhan coronavirus ,2020-01-21,Nicole Wetsman,theverge,https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075647/us-wuhan-coronavirus-case-china-deaths-virus-illness,"A case of the new virus spreading rapidly in China has been reported in a patient in Seattle, Washington, Reuters reports. The patient had recently returned from China, and is clinically healthy but still being monitored. This is the first US case of the virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, a city in central China in late December 2019. It has already sickened around 300 people and killed six. Despite the case report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said during a press briefing that they believe the threat to the US remains low. The virus is currently known as 2019-nCoV. The designation indicates that it is a coronavirus, the family of viruses that also caused the SARS outbreak in 2003. That outbreak killed nearly 800 people. “It’s bringing back SARS flashbacks for me,” says Timothy Sheahan, a coronavirus expert and assistant professor at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health. The US patient flew into Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on January 15th and reported symptoms to his medical provider on Sunday, January 19th. The patient was familiar with the reports of the Wuhan virus and shared them with his provider, and the positive test for the coronavirus came back yesterday. He poses little risk to hospital staff or to the general public and is cooperating fully, the CDC said in its briefing. On January 17th, the CDC started enhanced health screenings at San Francisco International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, and Los Angeles International Airport for passengers who flew from or connected through Wuhan. The agency will begin screening at Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport this week. Any flights from or connecting through Wuhan will also begin to be funneled to those airports. Health officials’ experience with SARS makes them more prepared to respond to threats from coronaviruses, Sheahan says. “People are aware. Before SARS, people had no idea this could happen. I think everyone is much more prepared now in 2020 than we were in 2002.” Coronaviruses are common in animals, and can evolve into forms that can be passed to and infect humans. The virus that caused SARS, for example, originated in bats. The World Health Organization has identified a wholesale seafood market in Wuhan as a possible source of the virus, but it also noted that “some laboratory-confirmed patients did not report visiting this market.” One of the most pressing questions about the new virus is how easily it spreads. Chinese health authorities said this week that there has been at least one confirmed case where the virus passed directly from one person to another without passing through an animal reservoir. “The key issue we need to understand is how easily or sustainably the virus is spread from human to human,” says Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC. An expert panel at the World Health Organization is meeting on Wednesday, January 22nd to determine if it should declare a global public health emergency. Update January 21st, 3:08PM ET: This report was updated to include new information from the CDC. ",tech,

",sciencemag,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/arrival-sars-new-virus-united-states-heightens-concerns-about-global-spread,"Passengers wear face masks in a subway station in Beijing, one of several cities in China that have reported cases of a new coronavirus. By Dennis Normile, Martin EnserinkJan. 21, 2020 , 3:00 PM It’s hard to keep up with the outbreak of the new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan last month, but one thing seems increasingly clear: The virus isn’t going away anytime soon. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) just reported the first case in the United States, a patient who returned from Wuhan on 15 January and sought treatment in Washington after developing symptoms. Taiwan also confirmed its first infection today, and a boy in the Philippines reportedly tested positive for the virus. (Thailand, Japan, and South Korea have all previously reported cases.) The total number of confirmed cases again shot up today, to more than 300, including six deaths. Meanwhile, a panel of Chinese health experts confirmed yesterday what many scientists suspected or feared for a while: The new virus is able to spread between people, which means it could be a lot harder to control. The panel also said health care workers have become infected. The rapid spread heightened fears of a rerun of the severe acute respiratory syndrome episode in 2003, when a related coronavirus spread from China to more than 30 countries. “This outbreak is extremely concerning,” Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust, said in a statement today. “The urgent focus must be on evidence-based interventions. We do not have proven treatments or vaccines,” says Farrar, who added that the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which Wellcome supports, is “working with global partners to accelerate vaccine research for this new virus.” Chinese health authorities have now confirmed cases of the new disease in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and other cities around the country, some far beyond the central inland city of Wuhan. This trend could foretell a wider dispersion of the virus during the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday, when an estimated 400 million Chinese are expected to travel by bus, rail, and air to their hometowns. A panel advising China’s National Health Commission announced the cases of human-to-human transmission yesterday during an afternoon press conference. Later, the panel’s head, epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, elaborated in an interview with China Central Television, the state broadcaster. Portions of the interview were posted on China Daily. “It has been confirmed that two people in Guangdong province were infected through human-to-human transmission,” Zhong said in the interview. He explained that members of a Guangdong family who had returned home from a visit to Wuhan passed the virus on to two other members of the family. Zhong also said a number of medical workers in Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, have tested positive for the virus. The latter revelation raised questions about the accuracy of reports by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. In an 11 January outbreak update, the commission stated that no cases of illness had been found among close contacts, including medical staff. But more recent updates do not specifically mention medical staff. Chinese media reported today that it is now known that 15 medical workers in Wuhan have been infected. An editorial comment on ifeng.com, a Chinese news portal, blasted the commission: “If Zhong Nanshan had not said that medical staff were infected last night, would the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission continue to hide this information?” During the press briefing, George Gao, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the virus is adapting to humans, but he did not give details. Such adaptations would show up in the virus’s genome, but in an analysis he posted online, evolutionary biologist Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh said there is very little variation in the 14 genomes of the coronavirus available so far. Gao also said the presumed animal source of the virus has still not been identified.",science,

Coronaviruses are a group of viruses which included the likes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). These types of illness are transmitted between animals and people, which is why the market in Wuhan – where live animals were sold – has been shut. The illness causes a type of pneumonia and its symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases. The virus has so far infected more than 300 people and killed six.

70,70,"Coronavirus: Chinese hospitals not testing patients, say relatives | World news | The Guardian",2020-01-21,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lily-kuo,theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/21/coronavirus-chinese-hospitals-not-testing-patients-say-relatives,"On 12 January Huang got news his healthy 65-year-old mother had been checked into a hospital in the central Chinese city of Wuhan with a fever and a cough. There had been reports of a strange new virus with similar symptoms, and the hospital staff were dressed in full hazmat suits. Still, Huang’s mother was not tested for the mystery illness, nor quarantined from other patients. On 14 January she took a turn for the worse and was slipping in and out of consciousness. A CT scan showed her lungs covered in white nodules. The next evening, Huang’s brother and father watched her die. The official cause of death was severe pneumonia. Two doctors told the family privately that she had probably contracted the virus, but provided no documentation. It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as: Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. Yes. China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 19 March, more than 219,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 8,900 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 84,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus. The hospital pressured the family to immediately cremate Huang’s mother, but they refused, asking for more information. A few days later, they relented and workers from a funeral home, also in protective clothing, retrieved, cremated and buried her within a few hours, leaving the family no time to say goodbye. Afterwards, the staff disinfected the van they had travelled in and threw away their hazmat suits. “My mother’s death was dealt with without any dignity,” said Huang, 40, who did not want to give his or his mother’s full name. “She wasn’t even counted as a number on the government’s list,” he said, referring to the six people authorities say have been killed by the virus. China is on high alert as a new strain of coronavirus – first detected in Wuhan – spreads across the country. If hospitals are not screening for the virus then the number of cases, and deaths, could be much higher than those cited in official reports. Authorities reported three more deaths on Tuesday: an 89-year-old male, a 66-year-old male and a 48-year-old female. The government has confirmed 308 cases, with 270 of them in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. Cases have been confirmed in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Tianjin, as well as the provinces Henan, Zhejiang and Guangdong. Suspected cases have been flagged in 13 provinces across the country – many of them hundreds of miles away from Wuhan. Fifteen health workers in Wuhan have also been infected, according to authorities. The number of confirmed infections is likely to have been underestimated, according to international public health experts, who say there could be as many as 1,700 cases. On the microblog Weibo, another Wuhan resident posted images of her mother’s diagnosis of viral pneumonia and described the long queues of patients with similar symptoms late on Monday night, none of whom appeared to have been tested for coronavirus. “Could all these people suddenly have viral pneumonia?” she said. Another Weibo user complained earlier this month that his father showed the symptoms of the virus but was sent home from the hospital without any screening. The post later disappeared. The World Health Organization has said the recent rise in cases is a sign authorities are now more aggressively screening for the virus. It will consider declaring an international public health emergency – as it did with swine flu and Ebola – on Wednesday. The Chinese political body responsible for law and order said on Tuesday that lower-ranking officials who covered up the spread of the virus would “be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity”. During the Sars outbreak in the early 2000s, China initially withheld information about it from the public and vastly underreported cases of infection. The virus, which was also caused by a coronavirus, killed 774 people. Late on Monday, China’s National Health Commission confirmed that the new virus could be spread through human-to-human contact, heightening outbreak fears before the country’s week-long lunar new year holiday, which starts on Friday and during which hundreds of millions of people travel across the country. On Tuesday internet users posted photos of shops with shelves emptied of face masks. The price of protective face masks sold online has at least doubled, prompting criticism from the state-run China Daily paper, which described the behaviour of sellers as “immoral”. In Beijing, many commuters wore masks indoors and on the subway. In Wuhan, authorities have begun to control the number of people leaving and entering the city, according to state TV. Guards are keeping a 24-hour watch on the now closed Huanan seafood and animal market, suspected as the source of the outbreak. Tour groups are barred from leaving and random spot checks are being conducted on vehicles coming in and out of the city to see whether they carry live animals. Advice online has ranged from washing one’s hands to not using the self-service screens at McDonald’s. Some people said they had cancelled plans to travel home for the holidays. Some internet users posted notices from their employers giving them permission to work from home this week. At the crematorium in Wuhan, Huang said he met one other family whose relative had died in similar circumstances. He was not sure how his mother would have caught the virus. She had not gone to the seafood market, and was healthy and active. “Everyone said she was a good person – always helping people,” he said. “In the end, she died alone and no one had a chance to say goodbye.”",general,

China has confirmed 291 cases of patients infected with the new coronavirus as of yesterday. There are now 270 confirmed cases in Hubei province, home to Wuhan where the majority of the patients have been. Other cases have been found in Beijing, Shanghai and southern Guangdong province.  You cannot absolutely prevent the spread of disease into the country Brendan Murphy The virus - which can pass from person to person - broke out in Wuhan but four cases have been reported in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, raising concerns about its spread through international air travel. Australian government chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said biosecurity officials would begin screening passengers arriving on the three weekly flights to Sydney from Wuhan starting on Thursday. Passengers will be given an information pamphlet and asked to present themselves if they had a fever or suspected they might have the disease. But Mr Murphy admitted the measures only offered limited protection. He said: “You cannot absolutely prevent the spread of disease into the country. The incubation period is probably a week. ""It's about identifying those with a high risk and making sure those who have a high risk know about it and know how to get medical attention.""   Queensland's chief health officer Jeanette Young told reporters the suspected patient had been isolated at his home. She said: ""We've got one gentleman that we're following at the moment who has travelled to Wuhan and has developed a respiratory illness. ""We've done some tests on him and are awaiting test results.""  READ MORE: Disease X: 'SARS-like' virus spreading through China prompts alert  Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged Australians to remain calm. He said: “We are well prepared to respond to this situation and we will continue to monitor and take action where necessary.” He said the government would raise its travel advice for Wuhan  to level two which suggests people ""exercise a high degree of caution"" and urge Australians to reconsider travelling to the city. China is the largest source of tourists to Australia, with more than 1 million visitors arriving last year.  Chinese officials are warning that the virus can now spread from human-to-human contact. It was first thought that it only spread from animals to people. The outbreak has sparked the World Health Organisation (WHO) to call an emergency meeting about how to contain the virus from spreading across the globe. Officials have confirmed that the meeting will take place in Geneva tomorrow.   The urgent meeting has been called because the virus has been confirmed in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. A British tourist who has been named as Ashley Shorley is also feared to have been struck down with the contagious virus. Paramedics raced the 32-year-old to a hospital in Phuket in Thailand after a pneumonia-like infection spread to his lungs.   Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses causing illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. Fever, fatigue and dry cough are the main symptoms in the early stage of illness and some patients may not progress to a more severe illness. Hospitalised patients are said to have had difficulty breathing which is associated with Dyspnoea. Older patients with an underlying health condition were more likely to progress to the more severe side of the disease.

The virus has infected more than 300 people since it began circulating last year, but this would be the first time it has spread beyond Asia. Where does Coronavirus come from? Coronaviruses are a species of disease with several different resident strains. They can surface anywhere in the world, but the most recent outbreak can be traced back to China. Health officials identified the first cases of the strain in the Chinese city of Wuhan. READ MORE: Coronavirus outbreak: How to prevent coronavirus   Every case of the disease, dubbed WN-CoV by Public Health England (PHE) can be traced back to the city. However, recently Chinese officials have identified cases beyond the borders of Wuhan, in Beijing, Shenzen and Thailand. Now, it may have spread into the US, according to a source close to the CDC. A federal source from outside the organisation said they have identified one case, and the matter is the subject of a CDC media briefing to come later this evening in the US.  Is the coronavirus deadly? Coronaviruses come in several strains, and each strain has varying effects. The most dangerous human coronaviruses are MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. They cause Middle-East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome respectively, both which have spread with deadly outcome in the past.

WN-CoV, also known as 2019-nCoV, has killed six people so far, but the CDC says it is less deadly than its more serious cousin SARS, which broke out in China nearly 20 years ago from 2002-2003. All deaths took place in China, and the first two were in men aged over 60 who already had chronic health conditions. Authorities have identified another four deaths as a result of the virus since then, but they have not revealed whether they had other health problems. 2019-nCoV mirrors other coronavirus strains, with respiratory (breathing) problems the defining symptoms.

The risk of more infection is growing as millions across China prepare to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday. The virus is known as novel-coronavirus as it is a strain which has not previously been identified in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called a meeting for Wednesday to consider declaring a global health emergency. The outbreak began in the city of Wuhan and has caused fears of a repeat of China’s Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002/2003. SARS killed almost 800 people when it struck and was initially covered up. Read More: Coronavirus: Doctor warned of coronavirus 'big risk' 5 YEARS ago   The Chinese government initially limited information on SARs when it first began to spread in 2002. At the time there were also no government bodies in place to deal with a public health emergency. China did apologize in 2003 for its slow reporting of the outbreak and pledged to create a national medical emergency process. Leo Poon, a virologist at the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong told CNN of coronavirus: “What we know is it causes pneumonia and then doesn’t respond to antibiotic treatment, which is not surprising, but then in terms of mortality, SARS kills 10 percent of the individuals.”  So far there have been recorded instances of coronavirus in Beijing, Tianjin, South Korea, Japan, Shanghai, Taiwan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Thailand.

Investigations into SARS-CoV found it was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans.  Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals which have not yet infected humans. This current case of coronavirus has been confirmed as spreading from human to human. Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the national health commission team investigating the outbreak, confirmed the virus can be passed by human-to-human transmission. Speaking to state news agency Xinhua, Zhong said: “It took only two weeks to identify the novel coronavirus. “Currently, it can be said it is affirmative that there is the phenomenon of human-to-human transmission.”  What are the symptoms of coronavirus? WHO list symptoms of coronavirus as being respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Recommendations to help prevent transmission include regularly washing hands, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing and cooking meat and eggs thoroughly.

The virus has killed six people since it was identified earlier this month, reports say. READ MORE: Coronavirus warning: US confirms first case of disease in Seattle - is it safe to travel?  Coronaviruses are species of virus belonging to the subfamily Coronavirinae. The CDC explains that two human coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, have been known to frequently cause severe symptoms. It explains: “MERS symptoms usually include fever, cough, and shortness of breath which often progress to pneumonia. “About three or four out of every 10 patients reported with MERS have died. “MERS cases continue to occur, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula. “SARS symptoms often included fever, chills, and body aches which usually progressed to pneumonia.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), common human coronaviruses usually only last for a short amount of time, but symptoms may include: SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is caused by the SARS coronavirus, known as SARS CoV, the NHS website states. Coronaviruses commonly cause infections in both humans and animals. SARS has flu-like symptoms which usually begin two to seven days after infection, the NHS explains. The health body adds: “Sometimes, the time between coming into contact with the virus and the start of symptoms (incubation period) can be up to 10 days.” The symptoms of SARS include: After these symptoms, the infection will begin to affect your lungs and airways (respiratory system), leading to additional symptoms, such as:  The World Health Organisation (WHO) has shared how travellers can protect themselves from the coronavirus. “WHO recommends health authorities work with travel, transport and tourism sectors to provide travellers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators and at points of entry.” The WHO added that the best chances of reducing exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses including the coronavirus is primarily in safe food practices. They advise: SARS is an airborne virus, which means it’s spread in a similar way to colds and flu. If someone else breathes in small droplets of saliva coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person, they can become infected. It can also be spread indirectly, if an infected person touches surfaces such as door handles with unwashed hands. A person who touches the same surface may also become infected. The SARS virus can also be spread through an infected person’s poo. The NHS gives an example of this, stating that if a person does not wash their hands properly after going to the toilet, they may pass the infection on to others. The health body's website explains how to prevent the spread of SARS, and this includes stating not to travel to areas of the world where there’s an uncontrolled SARS outbreak. “To reduce your risk of becoming infected, avoid direct contact with people who have the SARS virus until at least 10 days after their symptoms have gone,” the NHS adds. To prevent spreading the infection, it's important people: In some situations it may be appropriate to wear gloves, masks and goggles to help prevent the spread of SARS.

The city's benchmark Hang Seng Index ( HSI ) ended down 2.8% as it received a double dose of bad news. First, Moody's downgraded the city's credit rating to Aa3 from Aa2, citing an ""absence of effective response and lack of clarity"" on how the government plans to address political and economic concerns. The city has been gripped by pro-democracy protests for months. Second, China confirmed that the Wuhan coronavirus — a disease that has killed at least four people and sickened more than 200 in the country — can be transmitted between humans . There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in Hong Kong. But there have been 14 cases in neighboring Guangdong province, including one in nearby Shenzhen. Shares of Hang Seng components were down across the board. Major property developers like Wharf Real Estate Investment Company and Hang Lung Properties were among the worst performers, having lost more than 4%. Chinese car maker Geely Auto was the worst performer — down 5.3%.

While the outbreak of the respiratory virus originated in Wuhan, the largest city in central China, market and economy analysts suggested that it could become a major economic risk for the region should it continue to spread. The timing of the outbreak is of particular concern, since it coincides with the Lunar New Year holiday , said Rajiv Biswas, IHS Markit's chief economist for Asia Pacific. Millions of people are expected to travel within China and throughout other regions in Asia during this time. Earlier this month, Chinese scientists identified the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus, the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia and spread as far as Canada nearly two decades ago. Since the SARS outbreak, China's international tourism has boomed, so the risks of a SARS-like virus epidemic spreading globally have become even more severe, Biswas said.

The outbreak is in the Chinese city of Wuhan in the Hebei province. Six people have reportedly died from the disease in China, which can cause pneumonia-like respiratory problems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Tuesday afternoon that a resident of Snohomish County in Washington state is the first confirmed US case of the disease. The man, who in isolation at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington, recently traveled from Wuhan. Last year, more than 60,000 passengers flew into the United States from Wuhan, a city 700 miles south of Beijing. That's about 1% of  airline passengers who flew from China or Hong Kong to the United States, according to the most recent annual data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Any slowdown to and from Wuhan would have limited impact on airline travel. But the concern is that the disease, which is similar to SARS, could spread and affect travel to and from a much wider part of China and even the rest of Asia, perhaps even reaching other continents. More than 100 staffers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are already being deployed to three US airports to check passengers arriving from Wuhan, China, for fever and other symptoms of the disease. It is a relatively rare step that was previously taken only during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, according to a CDC official. Read More Travel between the US and China was already affected in recent months by the protests in Hong Kong, which have been a drag on airline stocks. United ( UAL ) , which reports fourth quarter numbers after the bell Tuesday, warned investors that it will take a $90 million charge for issues related to the temporarily suspended flights between Chicago and Hong Kong last fall. The airline said there was reduced demand for travel on that route. At the time, Hong Kong was in the third month of mass demonstrations, although the United did not cite that as a reason for the suspension. United has since resumed that route. Shares of United fell more than 5% in morning trading Tuesday afternoon after the report of the first US case of the disease, while shares of Delta ( DAL ) and American ( AAL ) each fell more than 4%. Even shares of Southwest ( LUV ) , which doesn't serve Asia, were 3% lower Tuesday on fears surrounding the impact on air travel overall. Coronavirus explained: What you need to know And it wasn't just airline stocks being hit. US casino operators that own properties in Macau, China, were also sharply lower on what the outbreak could mean for their Asia businesses.

78,78,China confirms Wuhan virus can be spread by humans - CNN,2020-01-21,"James Griffiths and Nectar Gan, CNN",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/21/asia/china-china-coronavirus-sars-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) Officials in China are racing to contain the outbreak of a new virus that has left at least nine people dead and sickened more than 440, after it was confirmed the infection can be passed between humans . The spread of the respiratory virus to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and now the United States, is fueling fears of a broader epidemic, as China enters its busiest travel period of the year. Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus was first detected, announced a series of new measures Tuesday, including the cancellation of upcoming Lunar New Year celebrations, which had been expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people. Tour agencies have been banned from taking groups out of Wuhan and the number of thermal monitors and screening areas in public spaces will be increased. Traffic police will also conduct spot checks on private vehicles coming in and out of the city to look for live poultry or wild animals, after the virus was linked to a seafood and live animal market, according to a report by state media outlet the People's Daily, citing Wuhan's Municipal Health Commission. The new measures come after Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered ""resolute efforts to curb the spread"" of the virus Monday. Read More There are now fears, however, that efforts to contain it are coming too late, hampered by a slow-moving Chinese bureaucracy which failed to put sufficient measures in place in time. In the coming days, hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to begin traveling across the country and overseas as the annual Lunar New Year break gets fully underway, compounding concerns of a further spike in cases. Though infections were first detected in Wuhan in mid-December, infrared temperature screening areas were not installed in the city's airports and stations until January 14, according to state media. China is trying to stop the spread of a deadly new virus at the worst possible time of year More than 440 cases of the virus have been confirmed across China, with the majority in Wuhan itself, but also as far afield as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong province, near Hong Kong. The death toll rose to nine Wednesday morning. Among the victims are a 66-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman who died on January 20, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. The majority of those who have died as a result of the virus have been elderly and had pre-existing conditions. Cases confirmed worldwide Around a month after the virus was first identified in Wuhan, it has already spread well beyond mainland China. In Asia, cases have been detected in Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Japan, while authorities in the US confirmed their first case on Tuesday and there have been reports of potential cases in Australia. Despite initial reports that the virus was unlikely to spread between humans, Chinese health authorities have now said there is ""definitely human-to-human transmission."" One patient is believed to have infected as many as 14 medical staff in one hospital, suggesting the disease can be spread far more easily than previously thought. The specter of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia in 2002 and 2003, has loomed large over discussion of the current virus. During the SARS outbreak, Chinese authorities initially downplayed the dangers and censored coverage, preventing people from realizing the severity of the virus and taking action in time to stop its spread. Zhong Nanshan, an expert with China's National Health Commission who is investigating the Wuhan virus, told state media Monday that while it is not as serious as SARS, the number of people with the disease was ""climbing"" and suggested that the ""death rate at the moment is not so representative."" A study by researchers in the UK estimated that the number of infections in Wuhan is still grossly underestimated , with the real number closer to 1,700, based on the spread of the virus to other cities and countries in a relatively short period of time. US authorities announced the country's first confirmed case on Tuesday. The patient, a young man, had been traveling and arrived at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Washington state before health screenings for the virus began. Travelers wear face masks as they walk outside of the Beijing Railway Station in Beijing, Monday, January 20, 2020. Worldwide effort Even before cases were detected in other countries, the efforts to contain the Wuhan coronavirus were international. Wuhan alone has connections to dozens of overseas destinations, and Beijing and Shanghai have hundreds more. Airports across Asia have stepped up temperature screening of incoming passengers, as have several hubs in the US with connections to Wuhan, including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. With all indications that the virus has a relatively slow incubation time, however, these efforts may be insufficient to stop its spread. ""You cannot absolutely prevent entry into the country of a disease like this. The incubation period is probably a week,"" Australia's chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said Tuesday . ""It's about identifying those with a high risk and making sure people with a high risk know about it and know how to get medical attention."" Coronavirus explained: What you need to know He said that while there was no cause for immediate alarm, the true number of cases was likely far higher than currently reported and urged people to be vigilant about potential symptoms. Australian authorities on Tuesday quarantined a man in Brisbane who had returned from Wuhan with possible symptoms of the coronavirus. He will remain in isolation until his symptoms have resolved, Queensland Health authorities said. Raising concerns about how difficult it is to detect those with the virus, even if they have some symptoms, a patient in South Korea told doctors there she had developed a fever and muscle pains on Saturday and was prescribed cold medicine by a doctor in Wuhan, before being sent on her way. She was later confirmed to have the coronavirus during a check in Seoul. In the US, the National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine for the new virus, though it will take at least a few months until the first phase of clinical trials get underway and more than a year until a vaccine might be available. Scientists in Texas, New York and China are also at work on a vaccine, according to Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ""The lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats,"" Hotez told CNN. The World Health Organization will convene an emergency meeting on Wednesday to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of ""international concern"" and what recommendations should be made to help manage its spread.

79,79,Premarket stocks: When Netflix went toe-to-toe with Disney+  - CNN,2020-01-21,"David Goldman, CNN Business",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/21/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,"London (CNN Business) A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here . Netflix ( NFLX ) is set to report earnings after the bell Tuesday, and investors are cautiously optimistic that the world's largest streaming service can continue to keep its competitors at bay. But that task is growing increasingly difficult. What's happening: Netflix has 158 million subscribers worldwide, dwarfing its competition. For years, it was able to put plenty of sunlight between it and its rivals by spending big money on original content and using computer wizardry to determine just what kind of shows its customers wanted to watch. (People seem to like true crime documentaries, social media sleuths and cats.) But Disney+ is growing ... fast. Wall Street analysts believe the streaming service added more than 20 million customers in its first few weeks, and the company may hit its 2020 end-of-year targets far sooner than expected. It's brought forward its European launch too . Amazon Prime Video continues to grow, HBO Max is around the corner, and NBC just announced its new streaming service, Peacock . (HBO is owned by WarnerMedia, CNN's parent company.) That competition has hurt Netflix's stock. Read More Netflix's stock is down nearly 4% over the past year, a particularly dreadful performance given the S&P 500 gained about 29% in 2019. The stock has rebounded significantly in the past several months, however: It's up 5% in January and has gained nearly 16% since late October. The competition: The company restored some confidence in investors after posting relatively solid subscriber additions in the third quarter. But that was before Disney+ launched in November and "" The Mandalorian's "" Baby Yoda character warmed the hearts of millions of Star Wars' fans. So the fourth quarter -- the first in which Netflix went head-to-head with Disney+ -- was the true test. The company is optimistic: It estimated that 7.6 million new subscribers signed up for Netflix during the last three months of 2019. What investors are watching: Wall Street will pay close attention to whether or not Netflix can hit that lofty target. But it will also keep a close eye on Netflix's profit margin. The company spent $18 billion on original content over the past year. Although Netflix remains profitable, it's not exactly churning out earnings. If Netflix misses its targets, the stock could go on a bumpy ride: The stock rose or fell by an average of 7% the day after it posted earnings over the past four quarterly announcements, according to Refinitiv. That includes a more-than-10% dip in the second quarter after the company said it missed its subscriber targets. So take something to soothe your stomach this afternoon. Asian markets rocked by coronavirus China confirmed that the Wuhan coronavirus — a disease that has killed at least six people and sickened hundreds in the country — can be transmitted between humans. There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in Hong Kong. But there have been 14 cases in neighboring Guangdong province, including one in nearby Shenzhen. Taiwan has reported its first case after a woman fell ill after stepping off a flight from Wuhan. Asian markets took a beating Tuesday: China's Shanghai Composite ( SHCOMP ) slumped 1.4%, while South Korea's Kospi ( KOSPI ) and Japan's Nikkei 225 ( N225 ) closed down 1% and 0.9%, respectively. More pain: Adding to pressure on Hong Hong stocks was a credit-rating downgrade by Moody's, which cut the city's long-term rating by one notch to Aa3 from Aa2. ""The absence of tangible plans to address either the political or economic and social concerns of the Hong Kong population that have come to the fore in the past nine months may reflect weaker inherent institutional capacity than Moody's had previously assessed,"" Moody's said. Global growth expectations are ... growing A day after the International Monetary Fund slashed its global growth forecast , Bank of America released a survey of investors who say they are increasingly bullish on the world economy. The net percentage of investors who expect growth to improve this year grew by seven percentage points to 36% in Bank of America's January survey, the bank said Tuesday morning. That's the highest percentage since February 2018. The IMF now expects 3.3% growth in 2020, down from its 3.4% projection in October. Up next Capital One ( COF ) , IBM ( IBM ) , Netflix, and United Airlines ( UAL ) report results after US markets close. Coming tomorrow: Earnings season marches on with results from Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Texas Instruments ( TXN ) . The latter will shine a light on the health of American chipmakers.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday morning addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and touted his ""America First"" agenda. He encouraged other nations to adopt a similar nation-focused approach to economics and political relations around the world. Trump also spoke glowingly of negative interest rates in Europe and Japan and took another shot at the Federal Reserve. ""They get paid to borrow money, something I could get used to very quickly,"" the president said of countries that have adopted negative rates. ""Love that."" White House top economic advisor Larry Kudlow, talking to CNBC on Tuesday from Davos, said that U.S. economic growth will top 3% this year. Steve Schwarzman, billionaire co-founder of private equity powerhouse Blackstone, told CNBC on Tuesday he sees fewer buying opportunities because markets and assets have become so expensive. ""Everything is up. You have to see something reasonably remarkable in terms of your ability to improve the operations of a company,"" he said in a ""Squawk Box"" interview from Davos.

Boeing is in talks with banks to secure a loan of $10 billion or more, according to people familiar with the matter, as the company faces rising costs stemming from two fatal crashes of its 737 Max planes. The company has secured at least $6 billion from banks, the people said, and is talking to other lenders for more contributions. The total amount could rise if there is additional demand from banks, one person familiar with the matter said. Concerns are growing about a contagious strain of pneumonia in China. The outbreak of a new coronavirus in China killed six people, with confirmed cases nearing 300 ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, during which hundreds of millions of people are expected to travel. The outbreak has sparked alarm because the disease is in the same family of viruses as severe acute respiratory syndrome.

81,81,Climate change: HFC emissions are rapidly rising and China and India could be to blame | Science | News | Express.co.uk,2020-01-21,Sebastian Kettley,express,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1230843/Climate-change-HFC-emissions-rising-China-India-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-news," The emissions claim follows widespread reports atmospheric levels of HFC-23 were all but eliminated in 2017. Researchers led by the University of Bristol have, however, found concentrations of hydrofluorocarbon gas (HFC-23) are growing at worrying rates. HFC-23 is considered a potent greenhouse gas many times more devastating than carbon dioxide (CO2). Just a single tonne of HFC-23 is comparable to 12,000 tonnes of CO2. Although there is little industrial use for the gas, HFC-23 is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of manufacturing chemicals used in certain cooling systems. According to Bristol’s researchers, China and India are the world’s leading emitters of HFC-23. Since 2015, the two nations have announced initiatives to lower their emissions from factories producing the gas. READ MORE: China coronavirus symptoms: Pneumonia-like symptoms spread   By 2017 it was reported they countries have made great headway into abating their emissions completely. Climate change experts, in turn, expected global levels of atmospheric HFC-23 to drop by up to 90 percent in those two years. But according to a paper published today in the journal Nature Communications, the opposite has taken place. The study, led by researchers at the University of Bristol, found atmospheric concentrations were rising at a record pace in 2018. Study co-author Dr Matt Rigby said: “When we saw the reports of enormous emissions reduction from India and China, we were excited to take a close look at the atmospheric data. “This potent greenhouse gas has been growing rapidly in the atmosphere for decades now and these reports suggested that the rise should have almost completely stopped in the space of two or three years. This would have been a big win for climate.” It is very likely that China has not been as successful in reducing HFC-23 emissions Dr Kieran Stanley, University of Bristol HFC-23 is the byproduct of HFC-22 – a gas commonly used as a fire suppressant and cooling liquid in refrigeration units, in particular, in developing nations. In 2013, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) warned China and India stood at the forefront of HFC-23 emissions. The EIA said at the time: “Our investigators discovered that many Chinese and Indian facilities, despite having destruction technology readily available, are releasing or threatening to emit the by-product unless they receive additional financing to dispose of the chemicals.” DON’T MISSUS Space Force uniforms sparks ridicule on social media [PICTURES]Black hole mystery: Could discovery be a massive neutron star? [ANALYSIS]When is the next total solar eclipse? [INSIGHT]   In 2016, cutting HFC-23 emissions became a pledge of the Montreal Protocol – a global effort to protect and restore the damaged ozone layer. Parties to the Montreal Protocol signed the Kigali Amendment, pledging to reduce HFC emissions. China and India were not signatories to the Amendment, which by January 2019 had 65 counties onboard. Dr Kieran Stanley, the lead author of the study, said: “To be compliant with the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, countries who have ratified the agreement are required to destroy HFC-23 as far as possible. “Although China and India are not yet bound by the Amendment, their reported abatement would have put them on course to be consistent with Kigali. However, it looks like there is still work to do.  “Our study finds that it is very likely that China has not been as successful in reducing HFC-23 emissions as reported. “However, without additional measurements, we can’t be sure whether India has been able to implement its abatement programme.” The researchers estimate HFC emissions between 2015 and 2017 alone accounted for the equivalent of a whole year’s worth of CO2 emissions from Spain. Dr Rigby added: “The magnitude of the CO2-equivalent emissions shows just how potent this greenhouse gas is. “We now hope to work with other international groups to better quantify India and China’s individual emissions using regional, rather than global, data and models.” See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general,

""The NIH is in the process of taking the first steps towards the development of a vaccine,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauc i, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Coronavirus explained: What you need to know Fauci said it would take a few months until the first phase of the clinical trials get underway and more than a year until a vaccine might be available. The latest The virus, which was first reported at the end of December, has infected more than 200 people, according to a Chinese government-appointed expert. The bulk of the cases have been in China, but there have been four cases in Thailand, South Korea and Japan. Read More The virus originated in animals and can be spread from person to person. While most of the patients visited an animal and seafood market in Wuhan, a city about 700 miles south of Beijing, some did not. This new virus is a coronavirus , which is the same family as the virus that causes SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , which was first reported in Asia in 2003 and killed more than 700 people. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome , or MERS, which has killed more than 800 people since 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus. Working on a vaccine A team of scientists in Texas, New York and China are also at work on a vaccine, according to Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. China's coronavirus cases likely grossly underestimated, study says ""The lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats,"" Hotez said. He added that it's less challenging to develop a vaccine for coronaviruses than for other viruses such as HIV or influenza. ""Every virus has its challenges, but coronaviruses can be a relatively straightforward vaccine target,"" Hotez said. If a vaccine is developed, he said, health care workers might be among the first to receive it because they're exposed to infected patients. A second person has died from a new SARS-like virus in China It is ""remarkable"" that scientists are able to start developing a vaccine for a virus that was identified less than a month ago, he said. He credited Chinese researchers, who quickly sequenced and published the virus's genome. ""With SARS, it took almost a year to be able to identify and map the full genetic code,"" he said. ""Now we're doing this in just a few weeks."" 'An evolving situation' Fauci emphasized there are still many questions about this new virus. ""This is an evolving situation, and it's tough to predict ultimately where it will go,"" he said. ""But we have to take it very seriously."" A few things are clear. One, the virus jumped from animals to humans, just like SARS did nearly two decades ago.

(Nasdaq: VIR), a clinical-stage immunology company focused on immune approaches to treating and preventing serious infectious diseases, is issuing the following in response to inquires from multiple academic, government, investor, and media stakeholders. Vir is working to rapidly determine whether its previously identified anti-coronavirus monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) bind and neutralize 2019-nCoV, also referred to as “Wuhan coronavirus”. “We have a library of multiple fully-human mAbs that bind and neutralize coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS,” said Herbert “Skip” Virgin, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Vir. “These mAbs were discovered using our antibody platform that identifies mAbs from survivors of an infection. Some of these mAbs are able to neutralize zoonotic coronaviruses, and we believe may have the potential to treat and prevent Wuhan coronavirus. We are also exploring the isolation of new mAbs specific for this virus.” In addition to Vir’s mAb efforts, its scientists are planning to apply whole genome CRISPR-based screening capabilities (Vir’s innate immunity platform) to identify the host receptor that allows Wuhan coronavirus infection. This may allow additional approaches to address this rapidly emerging public health concern. “We appreciate the threat this pathogen presents, and are utilizing our technologies to determine whether we currently have, or can identify, therapies to neutralize this virus,” said George Scangos, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vir. “We don’t know yet if these efforts will be successful, but we are working aggressively to find out.” About Vir Biotechnology Vir Biotechnology is a clinical-stage immunology company focused on combining immunologic insights with cutting-edge technologies to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases. Vir has assembled four technology platforms that are designed to stimulate and enhance the immune system by exploiting critical observations of natural immune processes. Its current development pipeline consists of five product candidates targeting hepatitis B virus, influenza A, human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis.

A second man, a Chinese citizen, aged 20, is reported to be treated at the same hospital. The Chinese man arrived in Russia around a week ago but further details are scare. Neither case has been confirmed, stressed hospital sources, but the Russian authorities are on high alert over the spreading contagious disease. The first case involves 23 year old man named Arman Karakeshinyan who travelled from Shanghai to St Petersburg via Russian cities of Krasnoyarsk, in Siberia, and Moscow. He was met by a team including a doctor wearing biological protection suits and transferred in a special isolation ‘box’, as shown in pictures from. BAZA news outlet.   The head of Botkin hospital Dr. Alexey Yakovlev confirmed he has suspected coronavirus, according to reports. He contracted “acute respiratory respiratory infection” in China, say reports citing Russian health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor. His temperature was said to be 38C. The man is from Stary Oskol city in Belgorod region, and was named by Russian media tonight. It is not known why he was in China. In a separate case a Canadian man who flew to Moscow from Bangkok sought medical assistance.  Reports suggested he was suspected of carrying the coronavirus but doctors said he had food poisoning and was later permitted to fly on to Bucharest. An earlier suspected case in the Russian far eastern city of Khabarovsk was found to be negative.

86,86,China coronavirus MAPPED: Where has Coronavirus struck in China?  | World | News | Express.co.uk,2020-01-22,Tim Redigolo,express,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1231276/China-coronavirus-map-where-coronavirus-wuhan-beijing-shanghai-china-deaths," The Coronavirus has, in addition to striking in several Chinese provinces, already crossed borders with cases reported in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the US. One man is in quarantine in Brisbane, Australia, and is suspected of having the virus. The virus originated in the city of Wuhan with a now-closed seafood market confirmed as the source. The Wuhan virus belongs to the same family of infections as SARS, which originated in southern China in 2002 before spreading to 26 countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing around 800. The Coronavirus is also similar to the MERS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which first developed in the Middle East and killed 787 people in 2015. These types of illness are transmitted between animals and people, which is why the market in Wuhan – where live animals were sold – has been shut. READ MORE: China on alert as doctors warn of dangerous 'super-spreader' coronavirus phenomenon  As of January 22, nine people are reported dead as a result of contracting the Coronavirus. The illness causes a type of pneumonia and its symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases. The official infection total, as of January 22, is 440. But this figure could be far higher, according to experts, who have suggested as many as 1,700 people may be carrying the coronavirus.   Since emerging in Wuhan, the virus has spread to the provinces of Yunnan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Henan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Shandong and Hunan as well as to the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, as well as the autonomous region Macau. Cases of the virus have been reported overseas in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and lately the US. An Australian man has been quarantined in his home in Brisbane after being suspected of having the virus after he returned from a visit to Wuhan. The United States and many Asian countries have stepped up the screening of travellers from Wuhan.

[LATEST]Coronavirus could be in AUSTRALIA as man tested for virus [NEWS]  The virus could yet spread further within Chinese borders ahead of its New Year celebrations on Saturday. The Spring Festival is on January 25 and millions of people are expected to travel across China in what is known as humanity’s largest migration. Chinese authorities have advised people to look out for symptoms of fever, coughing, breathing difficulties and pneumonia. Chinese President Xi Jinping said: “People’s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed.” China’s leaders have warned lower-level officials not to cover up the spread of the virus. In a stark message, the political body responsible for law and order said that anyone who concealed new cases would “be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity”. The World Health Organisation, which is holding an emergency meeting on Wednesday in Geneva, said on Tuesday that the coronavirus was likely to spread to other parts of China and possibly other countries in the coming days. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: “More cases should be expected in other parts of China and possibly other countries in the coming days.” See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general,
87,87,Type 2 diabetes symptoms: Signs of high blood sugar include flexor tenosynovitis | Express.co.uk,2020-01-22,Adam Chapman,express,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1231667/type-2-diabetes-symptoms-flexor-tenosynovitis-treatment-blood-sugar," Type 2 diabetes is usually a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high. This is due to the pancreas not releasing enough of the hormone insulin, which is responsible for controlling the amount of blood sugar in your blood. Unchecked blood sugar levels, if left untreated, can cause a number of potentially life-threatening complications, such as heart disease or stroke. Recognising the warning signs associated with type 2 diabetes is therefore the necessary first step to getting diagnosed and taking steps to lower blood sugar levels. One warning sign to watch out for is early stiffness or clicking when you move the finger, which tends to cause increasing pain, usually in a single finger or thumb, according to Diabetes.co.uk. This is symptom is called flexor tenosynovitis, also known as trigger finger, a condition in which inflammation occurs around the tendons of the finger. As the health body explains, when the sheath - the protective covering in living tissue that surrounds the flexor tendons (the smooth cords that connect the muscles of the forearm to the bones in the fingers and thumb), becomes irritated, the flexor tendon catches and cannot flex smoothly or extend the finger. READ MORE: Type 2 diabetes: The sign in your eat that could signal the chronic condition  In addition to stiffness and painful clicking, swelling and redness of the whole finger can develop, with a bump or tenderness located where the tendon is catching and the base of the affected finger. “Eventually, the finger may not be able to straighten fully and become locked, in which case manipulation of the finger into extension may be necessary,” explains Diabetes.co.uk. L L Smith et al report that the prevalence of flexor tenosynovitis is estimated at 11 percent in patients with diabetes, compared to below one percent in non-diabetics. The health body also observed that prolonged high blood sugar levels lead to an increased likelihood of flexor tenosynovitis. DON'T MISS Coronavirus LIVE: At least nine dead as horror virus sweeps the globe  [INSIGHT]Lung cancer: Signs in your fingers and toes that could signal the disease [INSIGHT]High blood pressure: Sprinkle this on your meals to lower your reading [TIPS] Treatment will initially be designed to relieve pain and inflammation, which is why resting the affected tendons is necessary for recovery, explains Diabetes.co.uk. In the long-term, however, treating flexor tenosynovitis caused by high blood sugar levels will involve measures designed to bring blood sugar levels under control. There are two key components to blood sugar management - diet and exercise. Over the last couple of years, a low carbohydrate diet has gained increasing traction for its ability to lower blood sugar levels.  In fact, a recent study at Bispebjerg Hospital in Denmark, in collaboration with, among other partners, found that a combination of a reduced carbohydrate content and an increased share of protein and fat is an effective strategy for regulating blood sugar levels. The study, which was based on a comparative analysis of different diets over 12 weeks, also found that blood sugar levels improved independent of weight loss for the participants following diet with a reduced carb intake and increased share of protein and fat. For optimal results, however, a low-carb diet should be complimented with regular exercise. According to the NHS, you should aim for 2.5 hours of activity a week.  “You can be active anywhere as long as what you're doing gets you out of breath,” explains the health body. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include: You should consult your GP if you have any of the symptoms of type 2 diabetes or you're worried you may have a higher risk of getting it, advises the NHS. It adds: “The earlier diabetes is diagnosed and treatment started, the better. Early treatment reduces your risk of other health problems.” See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general,
88,88,Coronavirus outbreak in China traced to snakes -- ScienceDaily,2020-01-22,Wiley,sciencedaily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200122150028.htm,"The study notes that patients who became infected with the virus -- which is a type of virus called a coronavirus and was named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization -- were exposed to wildlife animals at a wholesale market, where seafood, poultry, snake, bats, and farm animals were sold. By conducting a detailed genetic analysis of the virus and comparing it with available genetic information on different viruses from various geographic locations and host species, the investigators concluded that the 2019-nCoV appears to be a virus that formed from a combination of a coronavirus found in bats and another coronavirus of unknown origin. The resulting virus developed a mix or ""recombination"" of a viral protein that recognizes and binds to receptors on host cells. Such recognition is key to allowing viruses to enter host cells, which can lead to infection and disease. Finally, the team uncovered evidence that the 2019-nCoV likely resided in snakes before being transmitted to humans. Recombination within the viral receptor-binding protein may have allowed for cross-species transmission from snake to humans. ""Results derived from our evolutionary analysis suggest for the first time that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV,"" the authors wrote. ""New information obtained from our evolutionary analysis is highly significant for effective control of the outbreak caused by the 2019-nCoV-induced pneumonia."" An accompanying editorial notes that although the ultimate control of emerging viral infections requires the discovery and development of effective vaccines and/or antiviral drugs, currently licensed antiviral drugs should be tested against the 2019-nCoV.",science,
89,89,Coronavirus outbreak: Horror fears deadly virus ‘could mutate’ as death toll rises | World | News | Express.co.uk,2020-01-22,Joel Day ,express,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1231610/Coronavirus-virus-china-news-us-nine-dead-breaking-news-death-toll," China’s health ministry has confirmed the instance of human-to-human transmission of a mysterious Sars-like virus that has spread across the country. As well as this, reports have emerged that China's Macau province has seen the first instance of a person carrying the virus. The news has fuelled anxiety about the prospect of coronavirus spreading more easily across borders - just as millions begin travelling for lunar new year celebrations. Confirming two cases of the infection in China’s Guangdong province having been caused by human-to-human transmission, Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert, warned over the potential for the virus to garner strength as it passes from east to west. Over the weekend, the number of people infected with the virus tripled, with some 139 new cases. It brought the total number of people infected to 440 cases.   Most of those infected are isolated to the province of Wuhan, though the respiratory illness has also been detected in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. The new strain of coronavirus causes a type of pneumonia. The virus is thought to have originated from a market. Though, officials and scientists are yet to determine exactly how it has been spreading so quickly. JUST IN: Coronavirus symptoms: Where does coronavirus come from? Is it deadly?  Many have drawn parallels to the Sars virus - also a coronavirus - that broke out in the early 2000s. The death toll then came to 774 and spanned across a dozen countries - mostly in Asia. Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it i more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus. Reports have emerged that the actual number of those infected has been largely understated. DON'T MISS Coronavirus outbreak: How to prevent coronavirus [LATEST]Coronavirus: WHO warn deadly disease ‘expected to spread abroad' [UPDATE]Coronavirus outbreak strikes US as first case declared  [ANALYSIS]   Experts told the BBC that the amount of people involved is closer to 1,700 than the 440 reported. Yesterday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed the first case of Coronavirus in the United States after a traveller from China was diagnosed in Seattle in the Washington state. Although most of the cases reported so far have been isolated to China, some have emerged in Thailand South Korea and Japan. The symptoms of coronavirus are fever, fatigue, sore throat and a cough.  Patients may also have difficulties in breathing. When the virus was first contracted by humans from a seafood market in Wuhan, experts believed it could not be easily spread from human to human. All coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they can be transferred between people and animals. In 1918 the Spanish flu pandemic infected about 500 million people globally, which was a third of the world’s population.  However, a sharp rise in the disease since its initial discovery in December has proved the doctors wrong. China has sold out of face masks and officials at airports are trying to control the outbreak. The masks were being sold for ten times their original price.

90,90,Stomach bloating: Drinking peppermint tea could reduce abdominal pain and bloating | Express.co.uk,2020-01-22,Chanel Georgina,express,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1231785/stomach-bloating-peppermint-tea-reduce-abdominal-symptoms," The next time you feel your tummy is stretched and puffy, head straight to the kitchen to make yourself a brew. But not any type of brew, studies reveal that peppermint tea could reduce abdominal pain and bloating. The cool, refreshing flavour of peppermint (Mentha piperita) has been recognised in traditional medicine as helping to soothe digestive issues. Now studies confirm the plant contains flavonoids, which may inhibit the activity of mast cells (immune system cells found in the gut that sometimes contribute to bloating). Animal studies also show that peppermint relaxes the gut, which may relieve intestinal spasms — as well as bloating and pain that can accompany them. Furthermore, a study found that a single tea bag supplied six times more peppermint oil than a serving of peppermint leaf capsules. This suggests that peppermint tea is more beneficial than peppermint supplements. The NHS lists the following potential causes for bloating: READ MORE: Coronavirus latest: Dr Zoe Williams reveals vital sign UK doctors are looking out for  For excess wind, the health body suggests cutting down on certain foods. These include: Constipated? Consume more fibre in your diet, drink lots of water and exercise more.

Signs of the deadly condition [INSIGHT]Visceral fat level: Three ways to measure how much of the harmful belly fat you have [TIPS]  The NHS adds: “Sit down to eat (sitting upright and not slumped over), reduce the amount of fizzy drinks you consume, stop chewing gum and chew with your mouth closed so that you're not taking in excess air.” A food intolerance can lead to a bloated stomach when a reaction to the food causes too much gas to be produced. Common culprits are wheat, gluten and dairy products, such as cheese, milk and yoghurt. If you believe feelings of bloating is linked to a food intolerance you might have, it’s best to keep a food diary to check when symptoms flare up.  Speaking of a gluten intolerance, Coeliac disease is a common digestive condition where the intestines can’t absorb gluten. Symptoms of Coeliac disease include fatigue and diarrhoea, as well as abdominal pain. Those who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) frequently complain of bloating, too. Dr Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital in London, said: “Most digestive problems are to do with lifestyle, the foods we've eaten, or stress.  “Taking steps to change your lifestyle can help, and often prevent, many of these problems.” In particular, anxiety and worry can slow down digestion that leads to bloating. Although digestive problems tend to be harmless, and often settle down in good time, when the issue of bloating persists, it’s a good idea to talk to your GP to rule out any other serious health conditions.

91,91,Coronavirus latest warning: Latest warning on deadly disease - symptoms to spot | Express.co.uk,2020-01-22,Jessica Knibbs,express,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1232072/coronavirus-latest-warning-symptoms-statement-wuhan-china," Coronavirus has been sweeping across Asia including countries like Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and the United States and has now killed 17 people. Researchers have predicted up to 10,000 patients in Wuhan, China may have the virus and its been reported that transport networks in the city have been closed, ordering citizens not to leave. This comes after an earlier announcement that Heathrow airport is taking preventative measures to combat the spread of the deadly virus with passengers from China being isolated from other fliers. The World Health Organisation (WHO) held an emergency committee in Geneva this afternoon to assess the global risks posed by the virus and will decide if it should declared an international public health emergency, similar to what happened with swine flu and Ebola. The Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England have issued a statement on the coronavirus situation. The statement read: “We have been carefully monitoring the coronavirus situation in Wuhan and are ready to put in place proportionate, precautionary measures. ""From today, enhanced monitoring will be in place from all direct flights from Wuhan to the UK. ""The enhanced monitoring package includes a number of measures to provide advice to travellers if they feel unwell. ""They will check for symptoms of coronavirus and provide information to all passengers about symptoms and what to do if they become ill. Mandarin and Cantonese language support will be available to Public Health England (PHE) and leaflets will be available to passengers. ""Leaflets and information will be made available across all UK airports, advising travellers from China on what to do if they feel unwell.” READ MORE: Heart attack: Adding this food item to your breakfast daily could reduce your risk  Cases of the virus have risen almost 10-fold in the space of a few days, with just 48 confirmed cases on January 17. Professor Neil Ferguson, a biologist at Imperial College London, told a briefing in London this morning: “There appears to be what are called 'super-spreading' events which are events where one person can infect many others, which is similar to what we [saw] from the MERS and SARS coronaviruses. ""Based on the numbers we've seen with onset dates up to 18th January we've updated our estimate of the number of cases in Wuhan to about 4,000 with an uncertainty range of 1,000 to 9,700.” What is coronavirus? The virus, known also as 2019-nCoV, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans. The SARS virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000’s was also a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild respiratory infections such as the common cold. However, the virus can also be deadly as it can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and has already killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong.  What are the symptoms? Symptoms of the virus include a fever, cough and trouble breathing. Some patients have reported to have pneumonia symptoms and is a life-threatening infection that causes inflammation of the small air sacs in the lungs. Signs of infection with the new virus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. The first US case was confirmed on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said the situation was ""totally under control"" and that he trusted the information being provided by Chinese authorities.  The PHE statement said: “The UK is well prepared for new diseases and our approach is kept under constant review. ""UK public health measures are world-leading and the NHS is well prepared to manage and treat new diseases.” Dr Nick Phin, deputy director at the National Infection Service, PHE continued: “This is a new and rapidly evolving situation where information on cases and the virus is being gathered and assessed daily. ""Based on the available evidence, the current risk to the UK is considered low. We are working with the WHO and other international partners, have issued advice to the NHS and are keeping the situation under constant review. ""Individuals should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK.

However, the WHO did not arrive at a decision and instead opted to reconvene tomorrow. The WHO was due to reveal whether it would declare an international emergency today as countries tackle an outbreak of a novel coronavirus. Named 2019-CoV, the virus is a little-known member of the coronavirus ""family"", which has caused more than 500 infections and 14 deaths since it emerged in China last year. The virus has since spread through several countries, among them Russia and the US, and health authorities fear it could spread further afield. READ MORE: Coronavirus: Deadly disease sparks fears of global financial meltdown    Speaking earlier today, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus revealed the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee, which directs global public health response, would convene once again tomorrow. Mr Ghebreyesus praised the Chinese response to the outbreak and ""excellent"" discussions in the committee but said members needed ""more information"" before making a final decision. He said: ""There was an excellent discussion during the committee today, but it was also clear that to proceed, we need more information. ""For that reason, I have decided to ask the Emergency Committee to meet again tomorrow to continue their discussion, and the Chair, Dr Houssin, has agreed with that request.""   ""The decision about whether or not to declare a public health emergency of international concern is one I take extremely seriously, and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence. ""Our team in China working with local experts and officials to investigate the outbreak. ""We will have much more to say tomorrow."" WHO defines a global health emergency as a “serious, unusual or unexpected” event.   The latest decision from the WHO comes as the Chinese government quarantined the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated. Chinese state media announced transport outside of the city would be ""temporarily closed"" from Thursday as authorities attempt to contain spread of the virus. Speaking via Twitter, China Daily said: “Public #transportation such as bus, subway, ferry and long-distance bus in Wuhan will be temporarily closed since 10am Thursday. ""All flights and trains departed from #Wuhan will be temporarily cancelled to reduce risk of spread of the new virus, local govt says."" According to Xinhua news, people have also been asked not to leave the city without specific reasons. The UK government has also set down its own travel warnings, advising against ""all but essential"" travel to Wuhan. Officials will also be conducting tests on those returning directly or indirectly from the city for signs of the infection. Experts believe the disease could eventually enter the country, as symptoms can take up to five days to appear, meaning screenings could miss people soon to fall sick.

But global financial markets fear the rapid spread of the virus could spark the same panic that sent shivers through the world economy following the outbreak of the apparent similar and deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) disease in 2002. This virus, which also originated in Asia, caused acute respiratory syndrome and killed 774 people across 37 countries, including Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, the US, Russia, Spain and South Korea. Coronavirus panic is now sweeping through Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng plummeted 2.8 percent on Tuesday in its biggest drop this year, while China’s Shanghai Composite index was 1.7 percent lower. Fears have spread into European and US trading sessions, with the travel and leisure sector in Europe extending Monday’s losses. Asian travel-related countries had also started to be impacted by the coronavirus fear, with Shanghai International Airport down 2.2 percent, Air China slipping 3.2 percent and China Eastern down three percent. SARS was eventually contained in 2003 but not before it had wiped out a huge $40billion from the global economy, with the US suffering losses of over $7billion.   SARS virus caused a big correction in stocks in 2002. If the Coronavirus spreads like SARS, watch out Will Meade At the height of the SARS epidemic in March 2003, the US stock market nosedived, with the S&P 500 plunging 16.2 percent in just four months to 788.9, while the Dow Index tumbled 17 percent during the same period. Will Meade, a former hedge fund manager at Goldman Sachs, fears the new coronavirus may spread the same heightened panic throughout global financial markets.

The investment bank said: “Subsequently, the sectors most affected were those related to travel, tourism and hospitality.” Rabobank believes investors are probably positioning themselves ahead of the Lunar New Year Holiday in China, which could see more than three million trips made to celebrate the occasion. It said: “Some investors may well have looked top lock in some profits, given the recent positive run and the elevated risk of further negative virus-related headlines.”  Coronavirus, which can cause pneumonia and has no effective vaccine, is being spread simply through breathing. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. The deadly disease is spreading at lightning speed, from Wuhan to highly populated business districts such as Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong. Thailand has also confirmed four cases of coronavirus, while the US, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have each reported one. Russia, which shares a 4,209km border with China and is a popular destination for Chinese tourists and business people, has increased border controls in a desperate bid to limit the spread of the virus.

An Australian man is in quarantine in Brisbane after returning from China with flu-like symptoms. The World Health Organisation said the outbreak came from an animal source in Wuhan. Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people, and the outbreak in Wuhan has been linked to a now-closed seafood market where live animals were reportedly sold.

The coronavirus is also similar to the MERS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which first developed in the Middle East and killed 787 people in 2015.    The World Health Organisation (WHO) is expected to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Nine people have died as a result of contracting the virus as of January 22. At least 440 people have been infected with the virus.

Around 11 million people live in Wuhan and it is a major transport hub. With many people expected to travel in China and overseas, there is a risk of the virus spreading further.  In the past, China’s government has boasted that as many as two to three billion trips are made during the Lunar New Year. This means the outbreak could hardly come at a worse time. Chinese authorities have advised people to look out for symptoms of fever, coughing, breathing difficulties and pneumonia.

It comes as the CDC has confirmed the first case of 2019 coronavirus in the US, adding another to the more than 300 cases identified by authorities since the virus began circulating earlier this year. The virus originated in Wuhan, and has since spread around Asia, in the neighbouring cities of Shenzen and Beijing, and into Thailand. The CDC has now confirmed reports that a case of 2019-ncov has been identified in the US. According to the organisation, one male patient was identified with the disease, and he is currently in isolation at the Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington.

The organisation has urged travellers to ""practice enhanced precautions"" in the city.   A Brisbane man who was being tested for coronavirus has been cleared. The man had recently travelled through Wuhan in China before returning to Australia. The vice-minister, Li Bin, said there was evidence that the disease was ""mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract"". But, China is still yet to confirm the exact source of the virus. Mr Li said: ""Though the transmission route of the virus is yet to be fully understood, there is a possibility of virus mutation and a risk of further spread of the epidemic.""

Koryo tours also tweeted about possible travel limitations to the country. Coronavirus originated in Wuhan, and didn't stray far from the Chinese city. Authorities identified more than 300 cases in total, most of which originated in Wuhan, but some have spread further afield. Officials in Beijing, Shenzen and Thailand have also identified cases. Speaking today, the CDC said it expects more cases of the virus will emerge in the US. Dr Nancy Messonnier, a CDC respiratory diseases expert, told reporters via conference call: “We do expect additional cases in the United States and globally."" They have a screening tool which allows them to effectively identify people coming into the country infected with the disease. The first sufferer in the US allegedly travelled back to Washington State before authorities started screening passengers. Additional reporting by Liam Doyle.

The National Health Commission (NHC) has authorised hospitals nationwide to quarantine any suspected carriers of the virus and their close contacts, against their will if necessary. Coronavirus has so far claimed nine lives in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and infected more than 460 other people across the country. Prevention and control of the outbreak has reached a most critical stage Li Bin Wuhan has remained at the centre of fatalities and infections since the outbreak was first reported at the end of December but cases are increasingly being confirmed in Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Macau, as well as the US, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. NHC director Li Bin said prevention and control of the outbreak had reached a “most critical stage”. Mr Li said: “Recently there has been a big change in the number of cases, which is related to our deepening our understanding of the disease, improving diagnostic methods and optimising the distribution of diagnostic kits.”  Gao Fu, the director-general of China’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said the new virus was adapting and mutating, making it difficult for authorities to control the outbreak. As China vowed to tighten containment measures in hospitals, the World Health Organisation (WHO) was holding crisis talks to decide if the coronavirus outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

98,98,Coronavirus latest: Briton feared to be diagnosed with China’s coronavirus has bird flu | World | News | Express.co.uk,2020-01-22,Carly Read,express,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1231984/china-news-coronavirus-latest-british-tourist-bangkok-symptoms-WHO," Ash Shorley, 32, was reported to have been the first person from the West to catch the deadly virus that has so far killed more than 17 people in China and other Asian nations. But after spending a month at a hospital in Bangkok where he had 4.4lbs (2kg) of fluid drained from his collapsed lungs, it has emerged he actually had a deadly bout of bird flu. Mr Shorley’s parents Chris and Julie, from Thornton, Lancashire, flew to Thailand to be with their son, who is now up and walking around. Mr Shorley’s father, 55, told The Sun: “He was two days from death. If he wasn’t so fit, he wouldn’t be with us now.” He also told LBC: “It’s been absolutely horrendous. “Any parent would not want this to happen to their child because it was touch and go whether he was going to live. “Touch wood, he’s now out of danger but at the time the emotional stress was unbearable.”   His son, a former sales manager, is now breathing on his own without the help of any medical equipment. It comes as more than 500 people in China are believed to have contracted the horror virus. The deadly disease is spreading like wildfire having struck Australia, South Korea, India and now, the US. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention last night confirmed the first case of Coronavirus in the United States after a traveller from China was diagnosed in Seattle in the Washington state. READ NOW: Coronavirus: What is Coronavirus? How does it spread? [NEWS]  The World Health Organisation (WHO) is deciding whether the virus should be categorised as an international health emergency. The symptoms of coronavirus are fever, fatigue, sore throat and a cough. Patients may also have difficulties in breathing. When the virus was first contracted by humans from a seafood market in Wuhan, experts believed it could not be easily spread from human to human.

[INSIGHT]China coronavirus: How serious is the China virus epidemic? [ANALYSIS]  All coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they can be transferred between people and animals. In 1918 the Spanish flu pandemic infected about 500 million people globally, which was a third of the world’s population. However, a sharp rise in the disease since its initial discovery in December has proved the doctors wrong. Zhong Nanshan, a top Chinese expert investigating the virus, told state media it is certainly a “human-to-human transmission phenomenon”.  China has sold out of face masks and officials at airports are trying to control the outbreak. The masks were being sold for ten times their original price. The virus originated in the city of Wuhan with a now-closed seafood market confirmed as the source. The Wuhan virus belongs to the same family of infections as SARS, which originated in southern China in 2002 before spreading to 26 countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing around 800. The Coronavirus is also similar to the MERS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which first developed in the Middle East and killed 787 people in 2015.
